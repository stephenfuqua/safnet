                    <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more
                        equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement has sprung from the grassroots of
                        religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (<acronym
                            title="InterfaithNews.Net">INN</acronym>) seeks to chronicle this movement by focusing

                        late of CoNexus Multifaith Media, and Stephen Fuqua. The intent was to create a useful
                        repository for interfaith news and stories on the Internet. With the support of the <a

                            Initiative</a> and the <a href="http://www.nain.org/">North American
                            Interfaith Network</a>, <acronym title="InterfaithNews.Net">INN</acronym> was launched
                        in August of 2002.</p>
