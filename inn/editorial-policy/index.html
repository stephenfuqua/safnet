                <h3>General Policy</h3>
                <p>InterfaithNews.Net (<acronym title="InterfaithNews.Net">INN</acronym>) publishes articles from many
                    different authors and sources. In choosing what to publish, our overriding concerns are: is it
                    consistent with our mission of publishing positive and spiritual and religious news? Does it further
                    interfaith work the world over, or otherwise promote the common weal? Is it non-partisan and more
                    unifying than dividing? Thus while we clearly believe all articles here have value, the opinions and
                    views expressed therein do not necessarily reflect those of the editorial staff, the United
                    Religions Initiative, or other sponsors and partners.</p>
                <h3>User Comments</h3>
                <p>In the interest of promoting dialogue and a diversity of viewpoints, a section for comments is made
                    available in most articles &mdash; particularly those of an editorial nature. Readers are encouraged
                    to
                    provide feedback or further thoughts in this forum, as well as submit their own articles through the
                    Contact page. Comments are considered to be owned by the poster; while we take no responsibility for
                    their content, we reserve the right to remove comments that are abusive of others or infringe on
                    copyright laws.</p>
                <h3>Financial Support and Advertising</h3>
                <p>In no case has financial support been received for publishing specific articles. Advertisements that
                    may appear on the website are clearly labeled as such. We are willing to except gratis copies of
                    published material for review but cannot guarantee that we will publish a positive review. All
                    advertising and/or referral fees are donated directly to interfaith organizations.</p>
                <h3>Article Contributions</h3>
                <p>Contributing an article here means that you grant <acronym title="InterfaithNews.Net">INN</acronym>
                    perpetual, non-exclusive serial rights to publish it at <a
                        href="/inn">http://www.interfaithnews.net.</a> You also acknowledge
                    that <acronym title="InterfaithNews.Net">INN</acronym>&#8217;s editor has the exclusive right to
                    choose whether or not to publish a particular article, and you grant the editor the right to edit
                    submissions for formatting, spelling, and grammar. We will only make major editorial revisions in
                    consultation with you.</p>
                <p>By submitting an article or comments here, you also warrant that you are either the original author
                    or are otherwise authorized to distribute the work. Any work found to be plagiarized or submitted in
                    violation of copyright laws will be removed immediately. If you are the author, you may wish to
                    submit your article under a <a href="https://www.creativecommons.org/">Creative
                        Commons</a> license in order to clarify your distribution rights; otherwise, it is assumed that
                    you reserve all rights due to you under international copyright conventions.</p>
                <p>If an article of yours is rejected, please don&#8217;t be discouraged &mdash; feel free to continue
                    sending new articles in the future, as long they are relevant to the intended audience and remain
                    largely non-partisan (not showing extreme favor to particular political or religious groups).

                            The InterfaithNews.Net service ran from 2002 through 2006, hosting articles on the
                            former
                            interfaithnews.net website and distributing a periodical newsletter to a mailing list of
                            a
                            few thousand. The original database was lost due to poor management of backups. This
                            version
                            of the site has been restored in 2021 through careful extracts from the <a
                                href="https://web.archive.org">Wayback Machine</a> with substantial stylistic
                            reformating for consistency. No editorial reformatting has beeen applied &mdash; all of
                            the
                            recovered
                            text has been preserved.

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
