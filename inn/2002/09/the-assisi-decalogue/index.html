                <h1>The Assisi Decalogue</h1>

                <h3 class="author">Published on March 17, 2002, by David Waters,<br />
                    a columnist for the syndicated Memphis, Tennessee Commercial Appeal</h3>

                <p>What if leaders of the world's major religions got together one day and denounced all religious
                    violence?
                    What if they unanimously agreed to make this plain, clear and bold statement to the world?
                </p>

                <p>&quot;Violence and terrorism are opposed to all true religious spirit and we condemn all recourse to
                    violence and war in the name of God or religion.&quot; It could change the world. At the very least,
                    it would be big news, wouldn't it? Apparently not.</p>

                <p>More than 200 leaders of the world's dozen major religions did get together Jan. 24 in Assisi, Italy.
                    Maybe you missed the story about it the next day. Most newspapers didn't carry it. And it was hidden
                    inside many of those that did. There was a lot of other news that day. The Enron hearings opened in
                    Washington. John Walker Lindh made his first court appearance.</p>

                <p>It's no wonder the largest meeting of world religious leaders in history couldn't even make the front
                    page. Pope John Paul II and a number of cardinals were at the meeting. So was Bartholomew I,
                    spiritual leader of all Orthodox Christians. So were a dozen Jewish rabbis, including some from
                    Israel. So were 30 Muslim Imams from Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Pakistan. So were dozens
                    of ministers representing Baptists, Lutherans, Anglicans, Methodists, Presbyterians, Pentecostals,
                    Disciples of Christ, Mennonites, Quakers, Moravians, The Salvation Army and the World Council of
                    Churches.</p>

                <p>So were dozens of monks, gurus and others representing Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs and Zoroastrians and
                    native African religions. They ignored the personal and political risk of attending such a
                    high-profile gathering.</p>

                <p>They convened and talked and prayed. They unanimously agreed to condemn every recourse to violence
                    and war in the name of God or religion. They also said, &quot;No religious goal can possibly justify
                    the use of violence by man against man." And that "Whoever uses religion to foment violence
                    contradicts religion's deepest and truest inspiration.&quot; They called their statement the Assisi
                    Decalogue for Peace. It consists of 10 mutual commitments to work for peace and justice in the
                    world, including this one:</p>

                <p>&quot;We commit ourselves to stand at the side of those who suffer poverty and abandonment, speaking
                    out for those who have no voice,and to working effectively to change these situations.&quot; On
                    March 4, the Pope sent a copy of the Decalogue to all of the world's heads of state.</p>

                <p>Maybe you missed the story. It didn't even make the newspapers the next day, hidden inside or not.
                    There was a lot of other news that day. Seven American soldiers were killed in Afghanistan. Israeli
                    troops killed 17 people in the West Bank. Mike Tyson got a license to box.</p>

                <p>What if leaders of the world's major religions got together one day and denounced all religious
                    violence &mdash; and no one cared?</p>
                <h2>Decalogue of Assisi for Peace</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        We commit ourselves to proclaiming our firm conviction that violence and terrorism are
                        incompatible with the authentic spirit of religion, and, as we condemn every recourse to
                        violence and war in the name of God or of religion, we commit ourselves to doing everything
                        possible to eliminate the root causes of terrorism.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We commit ourselves to educating people to mutual respect and esteem, in order to help bring
                        about a peaceful and fraternal coexistence between people of different ethnic groups, cultures
                        and religions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We commit ourselves to fostering the culture of dialogue, so that there will be an increase of
                        understanding and mutual trust between individuals and among peoples, for these are the premises
                        of authentic peace.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We commit ourselves to defending the right of everyone to live a decent life in accordance with
                        their own cultural identity, and to form freely a family of their own.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We commit ourselves to frank and patient dialogue, refusing to consider our differences as an
                        insurmountable barrier, but recognizing instead that to encounter the diversity of others can
                        become an opportunity for greater reciprocal understanding.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We commit ourselves to forgiving one another for past and present errors and prejudices, and to
                        supporting one another in a common effort both to overcome selfishness and arrogance, hatred and
                        violence, and to learn from the past that peace without justice is no true peace.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We commit ourselves to taking the side of the poor and the helpless, to speaking out for those
                        who have no voice and to working effectively to change these situations, out of the conviction
                        that no one can be happy alone.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We commit ourselves to taking up the cry of those who refuse to be resigned to violence and
                        evil, and we desire to make every effort possible to offer the men and women of our time real
                        hope for justice and peace.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We commit ourselves to encouraging all efforts to promote friendship between peoples, for we are
                        convinced that, in the absence of solidarity and understanding between peoples, technological
                        progress exposes the world to a growing risk of destruction and death.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We commit ourselves to urging leaders of nations to make every effort to create and consolidate,
                        on the national and international levels, a world of solidarity and peace based on justice.
                    </li>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
