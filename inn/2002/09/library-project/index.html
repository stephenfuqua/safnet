                    A national Islamic civil rights and advocacy group today launched
                    a major educational initiative designed to counter what it says
                    is a rising tide of anti-Muslim rhetoric in American society.

                    The Council on American-Islamic Relations' (CAIR) year-long
                    campaign, called "Explore Islamic Civilization and Culture," will
                    encourage Muslims to sponsor 18-item "library packages" of
                    books, videos and audio cassettes about Islam and Muslims,
                    which will then be distributed to as many as 16,000 public
                    libraries nationwide. A pilot program by CAIR's Los Angeles
                    office placed more than 2500 books and videos in 166 libraries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The $150 library packages contain materials such as the PBS
                    documentary "Islam: Empire of Faith," Prof. Jack Shaheen's "Reel
                    Bad Arabs" and "The Islamic Threat: Myth or Reality?" by Prof.
                    John Esposito of Georgetown University's Center for Muslim-
                    Christian Understanding. Other materials include a copy of the
                    Quran, children's books on Ramadan and mosque architecture, as
                    well as a book describing the experiences of African-Muslim slaves.

                            The InterfaithNews.Net service ran from 2002 through 2006, hosting articles on the former

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
