<p>
Dear Joel,
</p>
<p>
We have continued our efforts to promote and sustain Peace and
InterFaith Harmony at the grass roots level. We are going to have a
National Level Peace and Inter Faith Harmony Conference on
Sept. 14-15. The idea is to collate the grass roots issues of peace and
interfaith harmony with the national and international issues and
also to highlight the concerns raised by the people at the grass
roots level. We are working for last sixteen years with the people of
Islam and Christian religions and want to present their voices
to the wider audience.
</p>
<p>
This conference will also enable us to devise a Future Plan of Action
for next five years. HDC just finished its Strategic Planning and
want to discuss it with the Local Peace Committees and Women
Peace Groups (which comprise of Muslim and Christian people).
Hope that this conference will be a mile stone in our work to
promote and sustain Peace and Interfaith Harmony in this violence-
striken area.
</p>
<p>
Please give your suggestions for the success of this conference.
Peace,
</p>

                The InterfaithNews.Net service ran from 2002 through 2006, hosting articles on the former
                interfaithnews.net website and distributing a periodical newsletter to a mailing list of a
                few thousand. The original database was lost due to poor management of backups. This version

    <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
        sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
        has sprung from the
        grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
        to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
        and religious news, events,
        and resources.</p>
