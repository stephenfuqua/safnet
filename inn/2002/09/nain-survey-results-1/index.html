                <h2>Part One: About the Organizations</h1>

                    <ul>
                        <li>All three countries of North America responded, with representation from coast to
                            coast.</li>
                        <li>Most member organizations are local groups of individuals meeting monthly who report
                            growth
                            in their work. This gives individuals concerned with spiritual matters an
                            opportunity for expression
                            and involvement.</li>
                        <li>The common thread in the purpose/mission statements of all responding shows some
                            variation of the
                            Golden Rule - i.e., Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.</li>
                        <li>Interfaith groups emphasize dialogue over advocacy programs; these experiences
                            (visits, workshops,
                            study days, etc.) are successful in helping us become comfortable with one another
                            in our diversity.
                            Interfaith activities show a wide variety of interest and creativity.</li>
                        <li>Today, interfaith organizations have achieved a first level of success by creating
                            structures where
                            diverse religious groups can overcome ignorance and fear of one another. This
                            achievement has created
                            excitement, awe and gratitude among participants. Most seem ready for a next level,
                            though they may
                            not know what this.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Part Two: NAIN and the Organizations</h1>

                        <ul>
                            <li>NAINConnect: 1996 - 2000 were its strongest years. The responding organizations
                                show commitment
                                to NAIN with high percentages participating on the board and committees.</li>
                            <li>Today's falling off may be normal as the original purpose of NAIN - to create a
                                network - has been
                                achieved.</li>
                            <li>NAIN is generally helpful to members, but organizations may be looking for
                                something more today.
                                If they can participate in only one of many annual gatherings, NAINConnects may
                                not be their choice.</li>
                            <li>NAINews &amp; NAINet have also been helpful but need tweaking/updating for
                                better service to users.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Part Three: New Directions for NAIN</h1>

                            <ul>
                                <li>New initiatives for NAIN might include regional gatherings, monthly news
                                    briefs, and publications
                                    including a current directory and practical "how to" applications of success
                                    stories from member
                                    organizations.</li>
                                <li>New directions might include post 9/11 guidelines for interfaith work, a
                                    code of ethics for quality
                                    interfaith behavior, outreach to other continents, pilgrimages, and
                                    showcasing of world religions.</li>
                                <li>Some sort of Staff Person is important to NAIN to create and maintain a
                                    constant focus on NAIN and
                                    its potential. Position must be carefully thought through as it demands
                                    greater responsibility from
                                    Board.</li>
                                <li>This Staff Person would assist Board/committees, create more frequent and
                                    consistent interaction
                                    with member organizations, research and grow new opportunities for NAIN,
                                    provide resources for members,
                                    develop funding for NAIN, and work to move it to its next level of in-depth
                                    service.</li>
                                <li>NAIN is no longer a network only to care for members (though it will
                                    continue to foster this care),
                                    but a network to which members contribute from their collective wisdom and
                                    experience for the good
                                    quality of the Interfaith Movement itself.</li>
                            </ul>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
