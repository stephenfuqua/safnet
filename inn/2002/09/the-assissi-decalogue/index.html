      <b>Published on March 17, 2002, by David Waters,<br/>
      a columnist for the syndicated Memphis, Tennessee Commercial Appeal</b></p>
	<p>
      What if leaders of the world&#39;s major religions got together one day and
      denounced all religious violence? What if they unanimously agreed to make
      this plain, clear and bold statement to the world?
    </p>
	<p>
      &#8220;Violence and terrorism are opposed to all true religious spirit and we
      condemn all recourse to violence and war in the name of God or religion.&#8221;
      It could change the world. At the very least, it would be big news,
      wouldn&#39;t it? Apparently not.
    </p>
	<p>
      More than 200 leaders of the world&#39;s dozen major religions did get
      together Jan. 24 in Assisi, Italy. Maybe you missed the story about it
      the next day. Most newspapers didn&#39;t carry it. And it was hidden inside
      many of those that did. There was a lot of other news that day. The Enron
      hearings opened in Washington. John Walker Lindh made his first court
      appearance.
    </p>
	<p>
      It&#39;s no wonder the largest meeting of world religious leaders in history
      couldn&#39;t even make the front page. Pope John Paul II and a number of
      cardinals were at the meeting. So was Bartholomew I, spiritual leader of
      all Orthodox Christians. So were a dozen Jewish rabbis, including some
      from Israel. So were 30 Muslim Imams from Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia,
      Egypt, and Pakistan. So were dozens of ministers representing Baptists,
      Lutherans, Anglicans, Methodists, Presbyterians, Pentecostals, Disciples
      of Christ, Mennonites, Quakers, Moravians, The Salvation Army and the
      World Council of Churches.
    </p>
	<p>
      So were dozens of monks, gurus and others representing Hindus, Buddhists,
      Sikhs and Zoroastrians and native African religions. They ignored the
      personal and political risk of attending such a high-profile gathering.
    </p>
	<p>
      They convened and talked and prayed. They unanimously agreed to condemn
      every recourse to violence and war in the name of God or religion. They
      also said, &#8220;No religious goal can possibly justify the use of violence by
      man against man.&#8221; And that &#8220;Whoever uses religion to foment violence
      contradicts religion&#39;s deepest and truest inspiration.&#8221; They called their
      statement the Assisi Decalogue for Peace. It consists of 10 mutual
      commitments to work for peace and justice in the world, including this
      one:
    </p>
	<p>
      &#8220;We commit ourselves to stand at the side of those who suffer poverty and
      abandonment, speaking out for those who have no voice,and to working
      effectively to change these situations.&#8221; On March 4, the Pope sent a copy
      of the Decalogue to all of the world&#39;s heads of state.
    </p>
	<p>
      Maybe you missed the story. It didn&#39;t even make the newspapers the next
      day, hidden inside or not. There was a lot of other news that day. Seven
      American soldiers were killed in Afghanistan. Israeli troops killed 17
      people in the West Bank. Mike Tyson got a license to box.
    </p>
	<p>
      What if leaders of the world&#39;s major religions got together one day and
      denounced all religious violence &mdash; and no one cared?
    </p>
	<h3>
      Decalogue of Assisi for Peace
    </h3>
	<ol>
	<li>We commit ourselves to proclaiming our firm conviction that violence
      and terrorism are incompatible with the authentic spirit of religion,
      and, as we condemn every recourse to violence and war in the name of God
      or of religion, we commit ourselves to doing everything possible to
      eliminate the root causes of terrorism.
      </li>
	<li>We commit ourselves to educating people to mutual respect and esteem,
      in order to help bring about a peaceful and fraternal coexistence between
      people of different ethnic groups, cultures and religions.
      </li>
	<li>We commit ourselves to fostering the culture of dialogue, so that
      there will be an increase of understanding and mutual trust between
      individuals and among peoples, for these are the premises of authentic
      peace.
      </li>
	<li>We commit ourselves to defending the right of everyone to live a
      decent life in accordance with their own cultural identity, and to form
      freely a family of their own.
      </li>
	<li>We commit ourselves to frank and patient dialogue, refusing to
      consider our differences as an insurmountable barrier, but recognizing
      instead that to encounter the diversity of others can become an
      opportunity for greater reciprocal understanding.
      </li>
	<li>We commit ourselves to forgiving one another for past and present
      errors and prejudices, and to supporting one another in a common effort
      both to overcome selfishness and arrogance, hatred and violence, and to
      learn from the past that peace without justice is no true peace.
      </li>
	<li>We commit ourselves to taking the side of the poor and the helpless,
      to speaking out for those who have no voice and to working effectively to
      change these situations, out of the conviction that no one can be happy
      alone.
      </li>
	<li>We commit ourselves to taking up the cry of those who refuse to be
      resigned to violence and evil, and we desire to make every effort
      possible to offer the men and women of our time real hope for justice and
      peace.
      </li>
	<li>We commit ourselves to encouraging all efforts to promote friendship
      between peoples, for we are convinced that, in the absence of solidarity
      and understanding between peoples, technological progress exposes the
      world to a growing risk of destruction and death.
      </li>
	<li>We commit ourselves to urging leaders of nations to make every effort
      to create and consolidate, on the national and international levels, a
      world of solidarity and peace based on justice.
      </li>
	</ol>
