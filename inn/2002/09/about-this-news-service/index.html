                <h3 class="author">Joel Beversluis</h3>
                <p>Although I've sent out news ezines in some trial formats,previous issues have used other mastheads
                    such
                    as TheInterfaith Digest and the NAINews &amp; Digest. Now, after setting up a more collaborative
                    structure and a supporting web site,we've settled on a name: InterfaithNews.Net</p>
                <p>So, please join us in celebrating this "rollout"!</p>
                <p>Our focus is on the positive-news and ideas that promote understanding, cooperation and wisdom among
                    religious,spiritual and interfaith communities. We'll gather information that serves these purposes,
                    and,
                    in a periodic turn-about, offer it to a wider audience.</p>
                <p>This issue includes several articles relating to the events ofSeptember 11, 2001 as well as 2002.
                    Others
                    come from a growing list of contributors and organizations. For longer pieces, we've presented a short
                    "digest" below, with a link to the rest of each story.</p>
                <p>Please take your time to follow the links, because there's plentym ore good news, projects, events,
                    and
                    resources worth knowing about-much more than I can digest or reproduce here!</p>
                <p>Previous issues have generated very supportive comments on theformat and usefulness of this service.
                    Reflecting that support, the initial sponsors are the North American Interfaith Network, United
                    Religions
                    Intitiative and CoNexus Multifaith Media. Webmaster and interfaith enthusiast Stephen Fuqua ofDaystar
                    Productions is developing web software to process the information flow more easily. We hope others
                    will
                    join us int his venture to make it truly global and representative.</p>
                <p>Readers are encouraged to send this news along to your networks.One of the significant lessons that
                    people and organizations are learning is the enormous value gained from collaboration anddeveloping
                    relationships through networking.</p>
                <p>In fact, we do need each other!Out of our diverse gifts and voices will come a greater whole.</p>

                        The InterfaithNews.Net service ran from 2002 through 2006, hosting articles on the former
                        interfaithnews.net website and distributing a periodical newsletter to a mailing list of a
                        few thousand. The original database was lost due to poor management of backups. This version
                        of the site has been restored in 2021 through careful extracts from the <a

                        reformating for consistency. No editorial reformatting has been applied &mdash; all of the
                        recovered
                        text has been preserved.

            <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                has sprung from the
                grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                and religious news, events,
                and resources.</p>
