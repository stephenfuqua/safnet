                        From Dave Randle: Dear Friends<br>
                        Not too many years ago it would have been hard to imagine a joint
                        environmental statement coming from the Pope and the leader of the Orthodox
                        Church. However, in an increasing age of interfaith cooperation, many are realizing
                        that global partnerships and increasing moral leadership for the environment
                        is one of the best hopes we have to move toward a more sustainable society.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although words are not actions, they are a start and certainly more than
                        governments gave us in Bali at the recent World Summit on Sustainable Development
                        Prep-Com meeting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's work together to build a stronger interfaith coalition for Global healing.
                        Be Well, -- Dave

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        VENICE, Italy -- Joined by a video link, Pope John Paul II and the spiritual
                        leader of Orthodox Christians signed a declaration Monday stating that
                        protecting the environment is a "moral and spiritual" duty.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Both the pope and Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, who was in Venice, have
                        described the declaration as another step in helping bridge the nearly
                        1,000-year-old rift between the two ancient branches of Christianity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The signing ended a five-day voyage by Bartholomew around the Adriatic Sea --
                        from poverty-stricken Albania to prosperous Italy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The frail 82-year-old pope remained at the Vatican and signed the document
                        during a video link-up with Bartholomew at the Palazzo Ducale in Venice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "We are ... concerned about the negative consequences for humanity and for
                        all creation resulting from the degradation of some basic natural resources
                        such as water, air and land, brought about by an economic and technological
                        progress which does not recognize and take into account its limits," the
                        document said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Christians and all other believers have a specific role to play in
                        proclaiming moral values and in educating people in ecological awareness,
                        which is none other than responsibility toward self, toward others, toward
                        creation," the text said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The text, which does not outline any binding action, was the first the two
                        religious leaders have signed concerning the environment. However, common
                        declarations between the two are not unusual.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The declaration invites "all men and women of good will" to consider ethical
                        goals in the protection of the environment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        About 250 religious figures, scientists and environmentalists joined the
                        patriarch on the Adriatic trip -- his fourth crusade to point out ecological
                        problems. Other trips have taken him to the Aegean and Black Seas and down
                        the Danube River.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Adriatic faces pollution from raw sewage, herbicides, pesticides and
                        industrial waste which flow into the 420-mile Mediterranean offshoot,
                        surrounded by Italy and the Balkans.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Coastal habitats such as wetlands are gradually being destroyed. "This is a
                        serious and increasing problem with the further development of tourism," said
                        a statement from marine biologists who accompanied Bartholomew.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The conference said the main source of pollution in the Adriatic was the most
                        prosperous nation in the region -- Italy. Apart from pollution flowing from
                        the Po River, a large petrochemical industry near Venice has contaminated
                        seafood and there is no adequate monitoring program for the developing oil
                        industry along the Italian coast, the scientists said.

                    <p>
                        OSLO, Norway/GENEVA, 11 June 2002 (LWI) - Church of Norway bishops
                        have sent a strong appeal for the protection of the environment to
                        the Church of England. The Sellafield Declaration addresses the
                        threat to seas and shores by radioactive waste from the nuclear
                        fuel reprocessing plant at Sellafield, northern England.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through the appeal, the Norwegian church leaders are calling on
                        British authorities to " take all necessary steps to bring an end
                        to the life-threatening pollution as soon as possible."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A Church of Norway press statement says the declaration, handed
                        over on May 29 to the Church of England in London, originates from
                        the local communities and congregations along the Norwegian coast.
                        On its way down the coast from Kirkenes to Bergen, the document
                        was signed by bishops of the five dioceses bordering the North
                        Sea. The country's six other bishops sent their letters of support.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Norwegians are urging their sister church on the other side of
                        the North Sea to follow-up on the matter with the British
                        government. Both churches are signatories to the 1996 Porvoo
                        Common Statement between the British and Irish Anglican churches
                        and most of the Nordic and Baltic Lutheran churches.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under the Nordic Council, Scandinavian governments have criticized
                        British authorities over Sellafield, saying the facility posed a
                        threat to the health of the Irish and North Seas and the Atlantic Ocean.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In their appeal titled "Let Life in the Oceans Continue," Norway's
                        bishops say the existence of a majority of their coastal
                        communities is "inextricably bound to the sea. ... If the
                        resources of the sea become polluted the very existence of the
                        coastal people of our land--and of other lands--will be torn
                        apart." They stress that pollution created by radioactive waste
                        can cause irreparable damage for future generations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a covering letter the Norwegian bishops say: "We see our
                        initiative as one way of deepening the Porvoo communion as it
                        continuously invites us to share resources and concerns as we are
                        involved in service and witness to our societies and the powers [to] be."
                    </p>

                        organization for world peace. This week's founding meeting of the World
                        Council of Religious Leaders is a follow-through.

                        Elaborate Hindu temples, Islamic masajid and Buddhist monasteries are not quite
                        how the nation perceives the Deep South. Nor do most people expect to find
                        Ethiopian neighborhoods in icy Minnesota. But today, hospitals across America
                        routinely call translators as well as doctors for emergencies. Schools where 20 or more
                        languages are spoken present staggering intercultural challenges. Tamil-speaking
                        congregations, Hispanic radio stations and Vietnamese shopping malls testify to
                        the growing diversity of communities everywhere.

                        Diana Eck, Director of Harvard University's "Pluralism Project," has documented
                        this shift in mainstream religious life in her book, A New Religious America: How a 'Christian
                        Country' Has Now Become the World's Most Religiously Diverse Nation.

                        Muslims now outnumber Episcopalians in the United States. Los Angeles has more
                        variants of Buddhism than anywhere else in the world. Muslim Girl Scouts promise
                        to "serve Allah and my country." Nor is this solely an American phenomenon.
                        It is happening in many parts of the world.

                    <p>
                        How are local congregations responding to this exploding diversity? In this article a
                        few examples will be drawn from North America and Great Britain, though creative
                        interfaith work is happening everywhere in the world.

                        Pass-A-Grille Beach Community UCC, an 850-member congregation near St. Petersburg,
                        FL, has created an Interfaith Ministry Team to address the opportunities and challenges
                        of a multi-cultural world. They conduct monthly "Lunch-And-Learn" sessions where
                        representatives of neighboring non-Christian faith communities share their personal faith
                        and provide overviews of their traditions. Because women's voices often are not heard in
                        interfaith dialogue, this church insists on both male and female presenters. Lunches honor
                        the dietary requirements of the guests. These guests also offer something from their own
                        worship tradition in the church's regular worship.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Within weeks after each session, Pass-A-Grille members visit their guests' particular
                        community of faith. The team maintains a "world religions shelf" in the church's
                        library. It publishes an interfaith calendar, websites and general
                        articles in the church's newsletter. It invites members of other faith traditions to join them
                        for a "Labyrinth Walk For Peace" on New Year's Eve. When Muslims joined them this
                        year, the Christians soon discovered how their meditative walk was congruent with the
                        Islamic practice of haj or pilgrimage.

                        Plymouth Church, a large downtown congregation in Minneapolis, is participating with
                        other Christian, Jewish and Islamic communities to create more affordable housing in
                        their city. For the next five years, hundreds of volunteers from various faith traditions
                        will be working side by side to reclaim an urban neighborhood, while creating an interfaith
                        "neighborhood" of trust and understanding. Forming a partnership with Habitat for
                        Humanity, they hope to raise approximately $3 million for materials. They have
                        committed to build 55 units of mixed but affordable housing over the next five years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "The faith communities of downtown Minneapolis realized that two major benefits
                        would come from our cooperation on issues of affordable housing,"says the Rev. James
                        Gertmenian, Plymouth's senior pastor and a UCC minister. "First, we'd be more able
                        to make a significant response to our city's housing crisis. Second, the visibility of
                        our common effort would be a telling statement in itself, about the nature of faith,
                        the power of our mutual respect, and the passion that we feel about meeting a basic
                        human need."

                        Central Congregational UCC, Atlanta, GA, now houses four congregations in its
                        facilities &mdash; Jewish, Korean, Cuban and its own. These four come together occasionally
                        for worship, service projects and fellowship. Central UCC has conducted support
                        groups for interfaith couples, and made its Associate Membership category available
                        to individuals whose primary affiliation is with a non-Christian tradition but who
                        wish to associate with the congregation and affirm its covenant. It is currently
                        involved in a citywide effort to create a metropolitan interfaith organization.

                        In Vancouver, Canada, laity and clergy from various faith communities are meeting
                        regularly with politicians, economists and community leaders to address issues
                        of the drug economy, labor disputes, and privatization. They are part of the
                        "Faith and the Common Good" project in ten cities throughout Canada, encouraged
                        by the World Conference on Religion and Peace.

                        Hindu temples, historic synagogues, ancient churches and Islamic mosques now
                        face each other across busy roads in Leicester, England. Jain and Sikh temples
                        testify to the diversity of this community. Where nearby cities are suffering
                        racial and religious violence, Leicester has been cited for its successes in avoiding
                        conflict and fostering mutual support. In 1986, its faith communities organized
                        a "Council of Faiths" to encourage communication and cooperation
                        among themselves and to respond to government initiatives. It is regularly
                        involved in education, health care, police consultations, urban renewal, and
                        community building. In cooperation with the University of Leicester, the Council
                        of Faiths sponsors dialogues and educational opportunities in religious pluralism.
                        Interfaith gardening groups have planted and tilled plots around nearly every
                        house of worship in Leicester, and traveled to nearby Beth Shalom
                        (Britain's Holocaust Center) to work together in its large memorial gardens.

                        In London, two congregations &mdash; St. Andrew's Anglican and St. Anne's United
                        Reformed -- came together with an ecumenical vision to share a single building,
                        and with an interfaith vision to create the London Inter Faith Centre. Hosted by
                        two Christian churches, this center always works in close consultation with
                        other faith communities. Its goals are to build bridges between faith communities,
                        to broaden Christian perceptions of non-Christian traditions, and to facilitate
                        cooperation with other service organizations. Supported by the Blair government,
                        its mission has grown to national proportions. Following September 11 it
                        organized a number of Christian-Muslim forums. It publishes materials,
                        organizes conferences, maintains an interfaith library, and has developed a
                        "Certificate in Interfaith Relations for Christians."

                        Many US and international organizations exist to encourage interfaith work
                        at the global and local levels. Some are based on individual memberships and
                        some are networks of member organizations. Some are focused on spirituality,
                        some on dialogue, some on advocacy for human rights, peace and social justice.
                        One of the best resources is the Inter Faith Network for the UK.
                        Its small but able staff has published a manual for local interfaith efforts called
                        The Local Inter Faith Guide. The Inter Faith Network also has developed a
                        "code of conduct" that would be of great help to any new interfaith work.

                        General Theological Seminary in New York City is offering a course on "Religion,
                        Art, Culture and the City" (July 8-12). Using the city itself as an instructional tool,
                        the course will focus on how the city gives shape to both religious understanding
                        and artistic expression. The course will include s concert, a theatre event, an
                        architectural walking tour, visits to museums and cultural sites and a pilgrimage to
                        "Ground Zero" to explore religious imagery that has collected there. Taught by GTS

                        UK will sponsor a seminar on "Religion and Medical Ethics" (August 11-18). Recent
                        developments in science and medicine raise profound ethical questions about the
                        meaning and value of human life and the limits and purposes of scientific research.
                        This course will consider Jewish, Muslim and Christian beliefs and teachings in
                        the context of selected issues to do with medical ethics, in order to ask what resources
                        these three religious traditions provide for helping to think ethically about the challenges
                        and opportunities posed by science. Taught by Dr Tina Beattie, freelance writer, lectures

                        "Religious Freedom: Europe's Story for Today's World" will be the theme of the 31st
                        World Congress of the International Association for Religious Freedom (July 28 -
                        August 2, 2002, in Budapest, Hungary) The programme includes plenary sessions on
                        global aspects of religious freedom concerns, feature presentations on the challenges to
                        religious freedom Europe has faced and is facing, special thematic lectures, workshops,
                        devotional sessions, ceremonies and cultural evenings. The Congress will provide a forum
                        for networking with people from all over the world who are working on a variety of
                        religious freedom and interfaith issues. There will also be an "encounter area" which
                        will be available throughout the Congress and people are invited to join other

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
