                        <p><em>Via <a href="http://www.wfn.org/">World Faith News</a></em></p>
                        <p>KIGALI, Rwanda/GENEVA, 27 June 2006 ( <a href="http://www.lutheranworld.org/">LWI</a>) * The
                            inaugural meeting of the Inter-Faith Action for Peace in Africa (IFAPA) Commission ended in
                            Kigali, Rwanda, on 22 June with Africa&#8217;s religious leaders agreeing to use the
                            instrument for a peaceful future for the continent and all its people.</p>
                        <p>&#8220;We have begun the task of working together for peace. We have already gained
                            considerable experience in responding to the challenges of conflict and poverty through our
                            respective interfaith networks and organizations,&#8221; the participants in the 19-22 June
                            meeting stated in their final report.</p>
                        <p>Called for by the Second IFAPA Summit in April 2005, the IFAPA Commission will provide
                            guidance and enhance the effectiveness of the ongoing process of engaging religious leaders
                            in peace-building initiatives in Africa. The commission includes 23 persons representing
                            African Traditional Religion, the Baha&#8217;i faith, Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism,
                            Islam and Judaism.</p>
                        <p>Inaugurating the commission on 19 June, Rwanda&#8217;s President Paul Kagame commended
                            Africa&#8217;s religious leaders for choosing a faith approach that would &#8220;remove
                            ambiguities sometimes associated with individual religious communities regarding where they
                            stand in terms of peace.&#8221;</p>
                        <p>The convenor of IFAPA, Rev. Dr Ishmael Noko, general secretary of the Lutheran World
                            Federation (LWF), noted that the testing point &#8220;for any initiative for Africa,
                            including IFAPA, is whether we are truly and genuinely leading Africa out of an
                            &#8216;envelope&#8217; situation into development.&#8221; He had defined development as the
                            process of setting free one&#8217;s potential for self-affirmation and self-determination.
                        </p>
                        <p>The 70 participants attending the meeting also included representatives of the international
                            community, advisers and observers, and an international team of journalists.</p>
                        <p>Alongside the launch of the IFAPA Commission, the participants in the Kigali meeting heard
                            about the African Monitor, an independent body initiated by the Anglican Archbishop of Cape
                            Town, Njongonkulu Ndungane, to promote an African voice in the development debate. The
                            President of the Pan-African Parliament, Ms Gertrude Mongella, and the Vice-Chair of the
                            African Union Commission, Mr Patrick Mazimpaka, attended the inaugural ceremony and assured
                            IFAPA of the cooperation of these important regional governance structures and institutions.
                        </p>
                        <p>The conference also discussed conflict and post-conflict situations in Burundi, the
                            Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, Togo and Uganda, and
                            proposed possible action plans by IFAPA. Other issues included the women&#8217;s call for a
                            healthy Africa under the campaign &#8220;A Mother&#8217;s Cry for a Healthy Africa.&#8221;
                        </p>
                        <p>Water as a fundamental human development goal, its religious significance, and particularly
                            its necessity for the well being of vulnerable women and children, was also discussed.</p>
                        <p>Noko said the Kigali meeting was particularly significant as the seven religions represented
                            in IFAPA had agreed on a draft constitution and a proposed budget for the commission.
                            &#8220;We have never, since the foundation of this continent, had the seven religions
                            agreeing on principle,&#8221; he told journalists at a press conference at the end of the
                            meeting.</p>
                        <p>The draft constitution will be formally adopted at a Third IFAPA Summit planned for 2008.</p>
                        <p>The IFAPA Commission participants visited the Kigali Memorial Center and offered prayers for
                            victims of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, in which some 1 million people died. Throughout the
                            meeting, emphasis was made on the &#8220;powerful motivation and inspiration&#8221; provided
                            by Rwanda as the venue, in view of the dedicated peace and reconciliation initiatives by the
                            government, religious communities and the people themselves.</p>
                        <p>Anglican Archbishop Emmanuel Kolini told participants in the closing ceremony that, although
                            the Rwandan church felt abandoned during the genocide 12 years ago, the presence of IFAPA
                            made them feel embraced.</p>
                        <p>&#8220;If we are together, Africa will be peaceful,&#8221; he said.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
