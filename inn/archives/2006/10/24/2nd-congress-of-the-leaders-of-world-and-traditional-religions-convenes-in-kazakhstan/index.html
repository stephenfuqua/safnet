                        <p><em>Via <a href="http://www.wfn.org/">World Faith News</a></em></p>
                        <p>ASTANA, Kazakhstan/GENEVA, 14 September 2006 (<a
                                href="http://www.lutheranworld.org/">LWI</a>) - &quot;Political conflicts can no longer
                            be solved exclusively on the political level,&quot; Kazakhstan&#8217;s President Nursultan
                            Nazarbayev remarked in his opening speech at the Second Congress of the Leaders of World and
                            Traditional Religions. The two-day congress, which took place in the country&#8217;s
                            capital, Astana, began 12 September and was attended by some 180 participants. Religious
                            movements and their leaders are now a decisive factor in maintaining peace and security in
                            the world, he stated.</p>
                        <p>Expressing his pleasure in meeting with the leaders of world and traditiona l religions
                            gathered at the congress, the Kazakh president said their most important task was to call on
                            the people of the world to strive for peace, compassion and harmony. He suggested that the
                            United Nations declare an &quot;International Year of Religious and Cultural
                            Tolerance.&quot;</p>
                        <p>The congress brought the leaders together in 27 delegations from 20 countries to debate a
                            common Declaration on Religion, Society and International Security, discussing principles of
                            inter-religious dialogue, religious freedom and the role of religious leaders in enhancing
                            internatio nal security.</p>
                        <p>The delegations represented the world&#8217;s major religions, including Buddhism,
                            Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, Shinto, and Taoism, as well as representatives of
                            the UN, the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), European
                            Parliament, and other institutions .</p>
                        <p>Rev. Dr Ishmael Noko, general secretary of the Lutheran World Federation (LWF), among
                            attendees, had also taken part in the first such congress held in September 2003. At this
                            second meeting, he expressed his belief that it was essential that: &quot;faith community
                            leaders must themselves define the agenda for their interfaith relationships, rather than
                            allowing political interests to dictate the agenda. An example is the current predominance
                            of the issue of terrorism.&quot; Noko, who also initiated the &quot;Inter-Faith Action for
                            Peace in Africa&quot; process, underscored that &quot;religious leaders must recognize their
                            own responsibility,&quot; and understand &quot;the importance of not abrogating this
                            responsibility to governments alone.&quot;</p>
                        <p>The congress took place at the &quot;Palace of Peace and Accord,&quot; also known as the
                            &quot;Peace Pyramid,&quot; which was built between 2004 and 2006 according to designs by the
                            renowned British architect, Norman Foster. President Nazarbayev plans to create a center for
                            religious studies at the site.</p>
                        <p>As well as Noko, the LWF delegation included Bishop Yuri Novgorodov of the Evangelical
                            Lutheran Church in the Republic of Kazakhstan (ELCRK), LWF Area Secretary for Asia, Rev. Dr
                            Ginda Harahap, Dutch journalist Mr Praxedis Bouwman, and Ms Regina Karasch, public relations
                            officer of the LWF National Committee in Germany. After the congress, the delegation&#8217;s
                            schedule includes an invitation from Bishop Novgorodov to visit several ELCRK congregations
                            in Astana and Kokshetau.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
