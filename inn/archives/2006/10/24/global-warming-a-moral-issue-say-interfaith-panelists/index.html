                    <div class="entry">

                        <p>Reverend Sally Bingham of the Episcopal <a href="http://www.gracecathedral.org/">Grace
                                Cathedral</a> in San Francisco noted that her job as a religious leader is to "introduce
                            people in the pews to the fact that they are environmentalists." If a person attends church
                            and professes a love for God, then caring for creation is his or her duty, she explained.
                            "If you love your neighbor, then you don't pollute your neighbor's air." According to
                            Bingham, who is also Executive Director of the <a
                                href="http://www.theregenerationproject.org/">Interfaith Power &#038; Light</a> climate
                            change campaign, enormous potential exists for involving religious communities in the
                            environmental movement. If the 300,000 or so houses of worship in the United States reduced
                            their energy use by just 25 percent, this would save 13.5 billion kilowatt-hours of
                            electricity, five million tons of carbon dioxide, and US$500 million in costs, she noted.
                        </p>
                        <p>Bingham compared the popular argument among climate skeptics that the United States is
                            "economically dependent" on fossil fuels to the South's economic justification of slavery
                            prior to the U.S. Civil War. "When the moral aspect of [slavery] was introduced, the hearts
                            and minds of the people were changed." We need to move beyond the economics, she says, and
                            tap into the ethics of the issue.</p>
                        <p>Jo Anne Lyon, Executive Director of <a
                                href="http://www.worldhope.org/worldhope/aboutnew.htm">World Hope International</a>,
                            discussed the participation of Evangelical Christians in the environmental movement, an
                            involvement that dates back to the early 1970s. According to Lyon, Evangelicals identified
                            the environment as a "pro-life" issue as early as the 1980s.</p>
                        <p>A third panel speaker, Walter Grazer, Director of the <a
                                href="http://www.nccbuscc.org/sdwp/ejp/index.htm">U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops'
                                Environmental Justice Program</a>, reaffirmed the view that "Science has been used as a
                            weapon and not a source of wisdom." A common theme among panelists was that climate change
                            adversely affects America's "poorest global neighbors," a group whom the faithful are called
                            upon to protect.</p>
                        <p>Worldwatch Institute Research Director Gary Gardner echoes many of these perspectives and
                            highlights the potential synergies between organized religion and the environmental movement
                            in his new book <em><a href="http://www.worldwatch.org/node/4404">Inspiring Progress:
                                    Religions&#8217; Contributions to Sustainable Development</a></em>, released today.
                            "The world's religions have many assets to lend to the effort to build sustainable
                            progress," he writes, "including moral authority, a long tradition of ethical teachings, and
                            the sheer political power that comes from having so many adherents."</p>
                        <p>Once seen largely as a liberal, or secular, matter, climate change has recently surged to the
                            forefront of religious communities' priorities. "Global warming," says Reverend Bingham, "is
                            one of the greatest moral issues of our time, if not the greatest."</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
