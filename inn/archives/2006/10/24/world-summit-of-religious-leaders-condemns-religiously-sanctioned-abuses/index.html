                            The World Summit of Religious
                            Leaders, the largest interfaith gathering to convene in Russia since the time of the Cold
                            War, has closed by passing a resolution condemning terrorism, economic inequality,
                            environmental abuses and the denigration of moral values in the modern world &mdash; writes Sophia
                            Kishkovsky for Ecumenical News International.</p>

                    <div class="entry">
                        <p>
                            &#8220;We condemn terrorism and extremism in any form, as well as attempts to justify them
                            by religion,&#8221; reads the statement. &#8220;We deplore the activities of
                            pseudo-religious groups and movements destroying freedom and health of people as well as the
                            ethical climate in societies.&#8221;</p>
                        <p>
                            More than 200 religious leaders from several dozen countries have been deliberating in
                            Moscow for Summit, whose final resolution is addressed to the leaders of the Group of Eight
                            (G8) countries who are to meet in St Petersburg on 15-17 July 2006. </p>
                        <p>
                            &#8220;Attempts are being made to divide the world along religious or ethnic lines, to drive
                            a wedge first of all between Christianity and the Islamic world,&#8221; Russian President
                            Vladimir Putin said in his 3 July address to the gathering. &#8220;The world is practically
                            being forced into a conflict of civilisations.&#8221; </p>
                        <p>
                            Russia holds the presidency of the group of the world&#8217;s leading industrialised powers
                            this year and has sought to assert itself in a number of spheres from geopolitics to
                            business, and now religion. </p>
                        <p>
                            Putin promised to inform the G-8 leaders of the results of the religious summit, in his
                            address to the opening ceremony at Moscow&#8217;s President Hotel, a high-security compound
                            that was used by Communist Party leaders and is still run by the Kremlin. </p>
                        <p>
                            Patriarch Alexei II of the Russian Orthodox Church, which initiated the summit, emphasised
                            the role of morality in avoiding conflicts. Ayatollah Muhammad Ali Taskhiri of Iran praised
                            Putin&#8217;s efforts for seeking common ground with Islam and stressed that Islam is a
                            religion of peace. </p>
                        <p>
                            Israel&#8217;s Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi Yona Metzger, who leads mainly Jews of European
                            descent, supported him but also lashed out at those who deny the Holocaust. </p>
                        <p>
                            The Vatican delegation, led by Cardinal Walter Kasper, president of the Pontifical Council
                            for Promoting Christian Unity, is the largest, the latest indication of a reported thaw in
                            relations between the Russian Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church since the
                            election of Pope Benedict XVI. </p>
                        <p>
                            Many of the world&#8217;s top religious leaders are participating, including World Council
                            of Churches general secretary Samuel Kobia, Pope Shenouda of Egypt&#8217;s Coptic Orthodox
                            Church and the Grand Mufti of Syria, Baderddin Hassoun. </p>
                        <p>
                            Still, several major religious leaders were absent. In an interview with Rossiya,
                            Russia&#8217;s main state television channel, Metropolitan Kirill, the chairperson of the
                            Department for External Church Relations of the Moscow Patriarchate, said the Dalai Lama was
                            not invited so as not to jeopardise Tibetan Buddhists&#8217; fragile negotiations with the
                            Chinese government. </p>
                        <p>
                            At a news conference in June 2006, Kirill said the Pope was not invited so as not to
                            &#8220;mix historical events&#8221;. Benedict&#8217;s predecessor, Pope John Paul II, had
                            for years publicly expressed his desire to visit Russia, but the Russian Orthodox Church
                            resisted such a visit.

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
