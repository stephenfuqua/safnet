                            religious leaders meet President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</h2>
                    <div class="lead">
                        <p>NEW YORK, N.Y. &mdash; Nearly 45 religious
                            leaders from Christian and Muslim faith backgrounds met with the Iranian president, Mahmoud
                            Ahmadinejad, Sept. 20, in an open discussion about the role religious communities can play
                            in reversing the deepening crisis between Iran and the United States.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p class="author">By <a href="http://www.mcc.org/">Mennonite Central Committee (MCC)</a></p>
                    <p class="postdate">Sept. 22, 2006</p>
                    <div class="entry">
                        <p><a id="more-157"></a>
                        <p>This was the first face-to-face meeting between the Iranian leader and leaders from mainline
                            Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox, evangelical and historic peace churches. Much of the
                            discussion focused on a mixture of religious and political issues such as the harsh language
                            between the U.S. and Iranian governments, Ahmadinejad&rsquo;s publicly stated position on
                            the Holocaust and the role of religious groups in the nuclear weapons dispute.</p>
                        <p>The group met for about 70 minutes in a conference room Wednesday morning at the Barclay New
                            York Inter-Continental Hotel, 111 East 48th St., where President Ahmadinejad was staying
                            while in New York.</p>
                        <p>The event was organized and sponsored by Mennonite Central Committee (MCC), of Akron, Pa., a
                            relief, development and peace organization of the Mennonite and Brethren in Christ churches
                            in the U.S. and Canada.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;The Iranian government invited us to organize a conversation between religious leaders
                            and President Ahmadinejad,&rdquo; said Robb Davis, MCC Executive Director. &ldquo;As an
                            agency of one of the historic peace churches we viewed this as an opportunity to build
                            mutual understanding between two peoples who have lived too long with mutual
                            suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>Both Davis and Ahmadinejad opened the meeting with comments about their respective faith
                            positions.</p>
                        <p>In a prepared statement, Davis focused on the need of religious leaders in the U.S. and Iran
                            to pursue peace and encourage those in government to resolve differences peacefully.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;We believe that people of faith must come together to mend the breeches that exist and
                            seem to continue to grow between nations and faith communities in this time,&rdquo; Davis
                            said. &ldquo;This is why we are here&mdash;to talk, to raise difficult questions and to
                            begin to build relationships that will lead to honest and open exchange to confront the very
                            real divisions that tragically lead to animosity, hatred and the shedding of blood.&rdquo;
                        </p>
                        <p>Ahmadinejad said, &quot;At any point in the course of history when a group of people anywhere
                            in the world put their instructions into practice, they actually set themselves as examples
                            of peace, order and progress and served as role models for ideal communities.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>Davis followed with a question about the language being used by the U.S. and Iran, such as
                            President Bush referring to Iran as one of the &ldquo;Axis of Evil&rdquo; countries, while
                            Iranian protesters march through the streets shouting &ldquo;Death to America.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>Ahmadinejad responded by saying that &ldquo;Death to America&rdquo; does not mean death to
                            the American people, but in fact Iranians love the American people. What it pointed to, he
                            said, were problems with how U.S. government policy has negatively impacted the recent
                            history of Iran from the Shah to the present crisis.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;There was no cause for anger as they are not addressed to the American nation but to
                            the aggressive, unjust, warmongering and bullying U.S. policies,&rdquo; he said. He later
                            added that there are times when people need strong language to express themselves.</p>
                        <p>When asked about his controversial views related to the Holocaust, Ahmadinejad referred to
                            previous statements in which he raised questions about the Holocaust and said there is need
                            for additional historical research to be done about it.</p>
                        <p>He made a direct connection between the current conflict between Israel and Palestine and the
                            Holocaust in which he said the Palestinian people are being asked to pay the price of the
                            Holocaust. In this context &ldquo;the Holocaust is a European problem not a Palestinian
                            one,&rdquo; he said.</p>
                        <p>Acknowledging the millions of people who died in World War II, Ahmadinejad asked why so much
                            attention was being paid to those who died in the Holocaust and very little to the millions
                            of other civilians who also died.</p>
                        <p>Davis told Ahmadinejad that more dialogue was necessary on this issue. In a discussion among
                            the delegation members following the meeting some of the participants said
                            Ahmadinejad&rsquo;s responses on the Holocaust were less than satisfying, according to
                            Davis.</p>
                        <p>On the issue of nuclear weapons, Ahmadinejad said, Iran is not producing weapons and has no
                            need to. He also said that religious people should assume a role in monitoring the nuclear
                            activities in all countries, including the U.S. and Iran.</p>
                        <p>Ahmadinejad suggested faith groups should join with scientists to visit nuclear facilities
                            around the world to make certain countries are adhering to nuclear agreements.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;The president broke very little new ground in his responses but had some helpful
                            suggestions for the role of people of faith in engaging more deeply around the issue of
                            nuclear nonproliferation,&rdquo; Davis said.</p>
                        <p>Toward the end of the meeting, promises of further discussion and a possible visit to Iran by
                            a religious delegation were agreed upon by the delegation and Ahmadinejad.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Come in winter when the nights are long and we can spend many hours discussing
                            things,&rdquo; Ahmadinejad said. Davis closed by saying that in the Christian faith
                            tradition God calls on believers to pray for all leaders and that the delegation would be
                            praying for Ahmadinejad and U.S. President George Bush. Ahmadinejad acknowledged the point
                            and said he welcomed the group&rsquo;s prayers.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
