                        <p>Dear Readers,</p>
                        <p>When <a href="/inn/2003/03/15/eulogies-for-joel-beversluis/">Joel Beversluis</a> and I
                            launched this site <a href="/inn/2002/08/">four years ago</a>, we had a bulleted list of
                            purposes for the site and newsletter:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Provide an independent and central forum for news about inter-religious groups and
                                programs, including access to newsletters of diverse interfaith organizations around the
                                world.</li>
                            <li>Highlight <strong>good news and positive</strong> actions and activities of religious,
                                spiritual and inter-religious communities.</li>
                            <li>Provide information about and links to selected resources and media such as
                                inter-religious organizations and directories, religious web sites and viewpoints,
                                multifaith materials and web sites, and other sources.</li>
                            <li>Provide an alternative to traditional media coverage of religion and spirituality, and
                                provide a reputable, common source for journalists to draw upon.</li>
                            <li>Provide forums for invited columnists and occasional other contributors to relay
                                analysis or personal views on issues of wide interest.</li>
                            <li>Offer this content in several electronic formats.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><a id="more-160"></a></p>
                        <p>Over the years, the <a class="dead-link" title="This link is no longer available">web site</a> has taken on a few
                            new identities and now hosts 156 articles. We&#8217;ve received praise from many individuals
                            and thanks for the work of providing the newsletter. We&#8217;ve had generous help from a
                            number of individuals and groups, particularly through our associations with the United
                            Religions Initiative and the North American Interfaith Network.</p>
                        <p>Reality check: though there is plenty of news to be told, it grows harder and harder to find
                            the time and motivation to continue with InterfaithNews.Net as a one-man show. Case in
                            point: this newsletter was intended to go out several weeks ago, in mid October really, but
                            here it is a week into November and it still will not go out for a few days. Personally, I
                            remain inspired by interfaith work and wish to continue facilitating news and stories about
                            it; I am particularly inspired when I see the great communities that other sites have
                            developed, such as the one at my favorite blog, <a class="dead-link" title="This link is no longer available">WorldChanging</a>.</p>
                        <p>I know that there are people reading this site — our web traffic logs show that — so what do
                            you want to see, and are you willing to help get there? Any potential bloggers or regular
                            writers and editors out there? Send your thoughts to the e-mail address below or post them
                            in a comment in this story (on the Web site) . The stories below make for interesting news,
                            but do not even scratch the surface of the countless inspiring, uplifting stories of
                            interfaith cooperation for peace, justice, and sustainability that are waiting to be told.
                        </p>
                        <p>Ultimately, as I do not have the time that I would like for this effort , I want to recruit
                            either a handful of qualified, regular contributors and/or a managing editor to coordinate
                            more regular and frequent site updates. Please let me know of your interest.</p>
                        <p>Peace be with you,<br />

                            The InterfaithNews.Net service ran from 2002 through 2006, hosting articles on the

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
