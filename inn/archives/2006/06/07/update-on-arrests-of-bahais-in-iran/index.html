                            <a href="http://news.bahai.org/story/450">were arrested</a> while teaching
                            children in a religiously-neutral setting. No indication has been given as to
                            the cause of their arrest. While most have been released, a few remain in
                            jail. Many in the international community see this as continuing evidence of
                            the renewed persecution &mdash; alluded to in our

                        <p>NEW YORK, 26 May 2006 (BWNS) &mdash; After their arrests on 19 May in
                            Shiraz, Iran, three Baha&#39;is remain in jail while 51 others have been
                            released on bail. No indication has been given as to when the three will be
                            released. None of those who had been released, nor the three who are still
                            being detained, have been formally charged.</p>
                        <p>On the day of the arrests, one Baha&#39;i, under the age of 15, was
                            released without having to post bail. At that same time, several other young
                            people who are not Baha&#39;is and who had been arrested with the
                            Baha&#39;is, were also released without bail.</p>
                        <p>On Wednesday 24 May, five days after their summary arrests, 14 of the
                            Baha&#39;is were released, each having been required to provide deeds of
                            property to the value of ten million tumans (approximately US$11,000) as
                            collateral for release. The following day, Thursday 25 May, 36 Baha&#39;is
                            were released on the strength of either personal guarantees or the deposit of
                            work licenses with the court as surety that they will appear when summoned to
                            court.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
