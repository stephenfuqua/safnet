                    <div class="lead">
                        <p>This year marks the 25th anniversary of the recognition of HIV/AIDS as a
                            new disease. In early June the United Nations held a &quot;High-Level Meeting
                            on HIV/AIDS&quot; to review world progress toward lessening the impact of
                            this pandemic. On the eve of the meeting, dozens of groups representing every
                            world religion gathered for a prayer service and a press conference
                            addressing the need for urgent action beyond mere words and declarations.</p>

                        <p>[Episcopal News Service] Renewing commitment toward overcoming the global
                            HIV/AIDS pandemic, people of faith joined in prayer at New York&#39;s St.
                            Bartholomew&#39;s Church May 30 &#8212; the eve of the United Nations High-Level
                            Meeting on HIV/AIDS, during which all UN member states will review progress
                            of the <a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/aboutunaids/unitednationsdeclarationsandgoals/2001declarationofcommitmentonhivaids"></a>2001 Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS.</a></p>
                        <p>Supported by more than 70 organizations, the interfaith prayer service,
                            &quot;Standing Together: Love Keeps the Promise,&quot; brought together more
                            than 200 people from Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, Sikh, and
                            other faith traditions, all uniting in a common mission &#8212; creating an
                            AIDS-free world.</p>
                        <p>An earlier press conference featured key faith leaders active in the UN
                            review, including Anglican Archbishop Njongonkulu Ndungane of Cape Town, and
                            the Rev. Canon Gideon Byamugisha, a Ugandan Anglican priest and founder of
                            the African Network of Religious Leaders Living with or Personally Affected
                            by HIV/AIDS.</p>
                        <p>Byamugisha, who will address the UN General Assembly June 2, was the first
                            practicing priest in Africa to declare his HIV status. He has since dedicated
                            his life to eradicating stigma associated with HIV/AIDS and mobilizing people
                            at all levels to take action against the pandemic. &quot;World leaders now
                            have an opportunity to vindicate the harsh pain of history,&quot; he said,
                            speaking of the UN review. &quot;We have an opportunity to take what we have
                            done right and do it better, and acknowledge what we have done wrong and
                            correct it.&quot;</p>
                        <p>Ndungane described the HIV/AIDS pandemic as a &quot;global emergency&quot;
                            that requires urgent action but insisted that there is &quot;no time for
                            wrangling over the wording of a political declaration when every minute of
                            every day a child dies of AIDS and a child becomes infected with AIDS.&quot;
                            &quot;Words, words, words won&#39;t help us in our fight against the
                            pandemic,&quot; he added. &quot;Now is the time for action.&quot;</p>
                        <p>Ndungane outlined three priorities toward achieving a world free from
                            AIDS:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>a comprehensive, holistic and integrated approach by all stakeholders
                                in dealing with the pandemic;</li>
                            <li>constructive and creative partnerships between governments, the private
                                sector and the broad church of civil society organizations including faith
                                communities; and</li>
                            <li>a huge resource mobilization in order to curtail the spread of the
                                pandemic.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The UN meeting will involve all sectors of the international community,
                            governments, civil society and the private sector. The opportunities provided
                            for civil society organizations to take part in the meeting is
                            unprecedented.</p>
                        <p>UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, in a message delivered at the interfaith
                            service by deputy executive director of UNAIDS Deborah Landey, said that in
                            the past 25 years AIDS has killed more than 25 million people, orphaned
                            millions of children and deepened poverty and hunger.</p>
                        <p>&quot;After a tragically late and slow start, the world&#39;s response has
                            gathered strength &mdash; in leadership, in resources, in bringing lifesaving
                            treatment to people the world over,&quot; Annan said. &quot;Now, we need to
                            move the response to AIDS to yet another level.&quot;</p>
                        <p>Annan explained that that is why the UN review is so important and why the
                            service at St. Bartholomew&#39;s is so encouraging.</p>
                        <p>&quot;After 25 long and hard years, we have learned that we can win
                            against AIDS only if we forge a truly collective front,&quot; he said.
                            &quot;We need the engagement of civil society, of faith-based groups, of the
                            entire global community. You provide strength and support for our struggle.
                            You reinforce our sense of common purpose.&quot;</p>
                        <p>In a printed welcome message, Presiding Bishop Frank Griswold applauded
                            the &quot;tireless efforts to end HIV/AIDS worldwide,&quot; but recognized
                            the &quot;alarming rates of infection of a disease that knows no boundaries
                            and does not discriminate.&quot;</p>
                        <p>Griswold recalled visiting a Ugandan bishop who had 60 orphans in his
                            home. &quot;These children were among the millions of faces of a pandemic
                            that is destroying a generation, destabilizing nations, and exacerbating the
                            grave crisis of global poverty,&quot; he said. &quot;We as a community of
                            believers are called by God to stand with our brothers and sisters who suffer
                            from HIV/AIDS and, strengthened by one another, must continue to work for the
                            end of this scourge.&quot;</p>
                        <p>Recalling a visit to Kenya in early May, H.E. Jan Eliasson, president of
                            the UN General Assembly, said that while in the Kibera slum he asked the
                            community to name their top priority for action. &quot;From all corners the
                            response came: HIV and AIDS,&quot; he said.</p>
                        <p>&quot;Over the next three days, the General Assembly has an opportunity to
                            show the world that it has heard the resounding call for action on HIV and
                            AIDS, and that it will act on it,&quot; he added. &quot;And act we
                            must.&quot;</p>
                        <p>Eliasson announced that 25 years into the pandemic, the rate of new
                            infections is such that around 500 people &mdash; half of them younger than
                            24 &mdash; will be newly infected before the service concludes. &quot;That
                            statistic reminds us that the international response to AIDS has been
                            woefully slow.&quot;</p>
                        <p>There are enormous grounds for hope and some progress is being made, he
                            insisted, &quot;but the challenge now is to ensure that this progress is a
                            springboard, not a plateau. The United Nations and its Member States need to
                            hear their citizens telling them that more must be done.&quot;</p>
                        <p>The UN review will feature a series of panel and roundtable discussions
                            and a high-level meeting will take place on June 2, which will culminate in
                            the adoption of a political declaration aimed at reaffirming and expressing
                            recommitment to the full implementation of the Declaration in the coming
                            years.</p>
                        <p>&quot;Our ultimate objective is a generation without AIDS,&quot; Ndungane
                            said. &quot;We believe that this is a real achievable possibility. We can do
                            this through developing appropriate programs that target young people, women
                            and children and help create sustainable livelihoods among communities,
                            especially the poor.&quot;</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
