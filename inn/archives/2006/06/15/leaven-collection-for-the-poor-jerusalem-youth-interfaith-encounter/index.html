                        <p>With the latest tragedies in Israel and Palestine threatening to shatter
                            the uneasy truce of the past year, it feels heartening to read stories of
                            Muslims, Jews, and Christians engaging in constructive face-to-face dialogue
                            and action. The Interfaith Encounter Association is a network of a dozen or
                            so &quot;encounter&quot; groups in Israel, including the Jerusalem Youth
                            Interfaith Encounter. This spring, these youth struck upon a unique service
                            project: gathering leaven from Jewish households that would otherwise go
                            unused during Pesach and distributing it to Arab families.</p>

                    <p class="author">By Jerusalem Youth Interfaith Encounter</p>
                    <p class="postdate">April 2006</p>
                    <div class="entry">
                        <p>In the previous story we share what happened in a study encounter that we
                            held, in which we studied about the ways Judaism and Islam recognize the
                            possibility of giving charity to people of other faiths. After we saw that in
                            both religions there is recognition of giving charity and acting with
                            kindness with any human being, even if he or she does not share your faith,
                            we went out in the beginning of April to implement the idea.</p>
                        <p>We printed announcements in which we wrote that this year there is a
                            solution for those who wish to get rid of their leaven before Pesach and at
                            the same time do good with it. We publicized the phone numbers of the
                            group&#39;s activists and their respective living areas in Jerusalem, in
                            order to allow anyone who is interested to bring us leaven products. In
                            addition, we appointed contact people in all three campuses of the Hebrew
                            University. But we did more than that. In one of the evenings before Pesach
                            we met at Nachlaot neighborhood in the city center, to collect leaven from
                            the neighborhood&#39;s houses. We divided into pairs, each consisting of one
                            Jew and one Muslim, one of whom is a man and one is a woman, and started our
                            way.</p>
                        <p>Visiting the neighborhood&#39;s houses was a very special experience. Many
                            of us took part in many interfaith encounters and events. Usually these
                            events happen in a very good atmosphere &ndash; due to the simple reason that
                            those who come are either already convinced or at least are open enough to
                            make the effort and come. In this visit to the neighborhood we could not
                            predict who will receive us with warmth and who will slam the door. It was a
                            real &quot;gamble&quot;. We did not look for those who are already convinced
                            but went from door to door. Without skipping anyone. Willing to encounter any
                            type of response. And indeed there were also unpleasant responses. There were
                            people who refused to donate once they understood the food is designated for
                            Arabs. Some protested: &quot;would Arabs collect food in this way for poor
                            Jews?&quot; From our perspective it was a major step. It is important to
                            remember in which environment we operate, how deep is the mutual mistrust
                            between the two people, how long is the way ahead of us. Whoever wants to act
                            and make impact should not delude themselves and must understand the
                            complexity of the reality. But it is important to stress that finally we were
                            surprised for the better. The vast majority donated. Some even added sums of
                            money, beyond the leaven product that were meant to be burned anyway. We left
                            the neighborhood with large quantities of food and it was clear to us that if
                            we had more time and more volunteers we would have collected a lot more.</p>
                        <p>We learned much from this round in the neighborhood on that evening. We
                            were filled with hope for reconciliation and understanding when we saw that
                            contrary to what we expected, most people agreed to donate for people of the
                            neighboring nation, despite the on-going state of war. We think that the
                            residents of the neighborhood also gained something from this evening, beyond
                            the opportunity to donate to the needy. It does not occur every day that you
                            are visited by a Jewish young man and a Muslim young woman or a Jewish young
                            woman and a Muslim young man. It is most likely that for most of the
                            neighborhood&#39;s residents it was the first time to see young Muslims and
                            Jews working together for a common idea. Perhaps this too was a small
                            contribution to the reconciliation process between us.</p>
                        <p>The last phase of this operation &ndash; which will be told next time
                            &ndash; was the distribution of the collected food. Unfortunately, most of
                            the Jewish members could not come. Those who could were afraid to go into the
                            Arab neighborhood in East Jerusalem (Siluwan) where the food was distributed.
                            And here we have another example that we should not delude ourselves. The
                            problematic security reality caused that our original plan, of Jews and
                            Muslims who will go together in an Arab neighborhood and will distribute food
                            to the needy, was fulfilled only partially. Indeed the way is long but as we
                            all know, even a journey of a thousand miles begins with one small step.</p>
                        <p><em>followup report on</em></p>
                        <h2>The Distribution</h2>
                        <p>Our operation was divided into two parts: collection and distribution. In
                            the previous story we shared the events and experiences that we had, as a
                            group and as individuals, during the planning and the performing of the
                            collection.</p>
                        <p>We would like to stress that when bringing into account the number of
                            members who participated in this operation and the actual time dedicated to
                            the activity, the amounts of food collected were considerable. During some
                            two hours of going from house to house in the neighborhood of Nachlaot we
                            managed to collect more than 150 Kg of food, as we estimate it. The food we
                            collected was varied and included rice, different pastas, sugar, sweets etc.
                            Many of the products were not even leaven and still were generously donated
                            to us.</p>
                        <p>When we planned the operation, we thought it would be the right way for
                            the Arab Muslim members of the group to actively and openly participate in
                            the collection, so that we can expose our activity to the wider public. And
                            indeed Jewish and Muslim members were going around the Jewish neighborhoods
                            of West Jerusalem together and in full partnership. The planning was that
                            also when we distribute the leaven to Arab needy (Muslims and Christians) the
                            Jewish members will participate actively and openly in order to get the same
                            desired effect in the Arab population of East Jerusalem.</p>
                        <p>When we were looking for an institution to deliver the food to, we were
                            surprised to discover fear and suspicion at the Arab population in East
                            Jerusalem. One of the queries we faced was: maybe the Jews will give us
                            poisoned food??!!! This query opened our eyes to the huge breach and the
                            enormous suspicion that exists between the two sides. This kind of remarks
                            just intensified our belief that we have to continue our efforts and that
                            there is still a lot of work for us to do.</p>
                        <p>Such remarks also forced us to accept only sealed food packages from the
                            Jewish donors&hellip;</p>
                        <p>Finally, after exploring different institutions, it was decided to give
                            the collected leaven to an old-people&#39;s home in East Jerusalem, which is
                            funded by private donations and is not supported by the authorities.</p>
                        <p>To our regret, on the day of delivery the Jewish members could not come
                            &ndash; due to each member&#39;s personal reasons. One of the reasons was the
                            fear of some of the Jewish members to visit the neighborhood where the
                            old-people&#39;s home is located, in East Jerusalem, and their concern that
                            they might be hurt by elements that will not be happy and will not bless
                            their presence in the neighborhood. We could have portrayed here a beautiful
                            ideal picture and to blur this detail, but it is important for us to present
                            things as they are. This fear intensified our thinking of how much we need to
                            continue working with vigor to bridge these worries and breaches.</p>
                        <p>The absence of the Jewish members from the distribution diminished a bit
                            the affect and momentum we were aiming to achieve in this operation. The
                            planned exposure of the Arab society in East Jerusalem to religious young
                            Jews who are &quot;different&quot; than the way usual stereotypes portray
                            them in the Arab society, would have significantly advanced the idea of our
                            organization and diminish, even if a little bit, the suspicions between the
                            two societies.</p>
                        <p>This absence forced the Muslim members to take the full role of both sides
                            and to represent also the Jewish side of the group in the food delivery. And
                            indeed, while we gave the food we made sure to present to those present our
                            organization and to explain its goals. In addition, and this is the main
                            part, we explained that this food was donated by Jewish people from Jerusalem
                            and that the Jewish donors clearly knew that this food will be given to
                            Muslim and Christian needy in East Jerusalem, and still they happily
                            donated.</p>
                        <p>The reaction we got the director of the old-people&#39;s home, who spoke
                            for all its residents, was warm and welcoming. She asked us to convey, in the
                            name of all residents of the place, their gratitude and appreciation to their
                            generosity and kindness.</p>

                            The InterfaithNews.Net service ran from 2002 through 2006, hosting articles on the

                            of the site has been restored in 2021 through careful extracts from the <a

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
