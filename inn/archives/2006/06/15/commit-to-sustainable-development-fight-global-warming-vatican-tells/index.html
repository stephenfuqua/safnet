                        <p>UNITED NATIONS (Catholic Online) &ndash; The international community must
                            commit to sustainable resource management policies that place the needs of
                            the human family and protection of the environment above commercial and
                            industrial concerns, the Vatican&#39;s representative to the United Nations
                            told a May 11 session of the U.N. Economic and Social Council&rsquo;s
                            Commission on Sustainable Development here.</p>
                        <p>Progress toward global sustainable development pales in comparison to
                            &ldquo;a sobering picture&rdquo; of the world&rsquo;s environment, said
                            Archbishop Celestino Migliore, the permanent observer of the Holy See to the
                            international body.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Essential improvement in living standards for all, while assuring
                            our world&rsquo;s environmental future,&rdquo; he said, will only occur if
                            there is an integrated international environmental and developmental policy
                            coupled with &ldquo;committed political follow through.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>In his remarks, Archbishop Migliore also pointed &ldquo;the serious
                            destruction of the human environment,&rdquo; the diminishing of water
                            resources, food security, global warming and renewal energy.</p>
                        <p>He said that, while many are &ldquo;rightly worried&rdquo; about the
                            &ldquo;irrational destruction of the natural environment,&rdquo; too little
                            attention is focused on protecting &ldquo;the moral conditions for an
                            authentic human ecology.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>The human person, the archbishop said, should be at &ldquo;the center of
                            environmental concerns&rdquo; in the affairs of nations, corporations and
                            individuals, while there is a simultaneous promotion of the urgency of
                            &ldquo;human responsibility for the Earth.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;As the essential symbiosis of life on the planet becomes
                            plain,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there is already a growing acknowledgement that
                            good environmental policies are by extension good people policies,
                            too.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>He pointed to the critical importance of water in the effort of building
                            sustainable development and the dire predictions for the global community in
                            access to that resource.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;This is already a humanitarian and environmental crisis, as well as
                            a question of social justice, Archbishop Migliore said, noting that 34,000
                            people die every day due to a lack of clean water and that 1.5 billion people
                            lack such access today, a figure that may double by 2025.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Within 20 years, the reserves of water per person will be a third
                            of what they were in 1950 and, by 2025, a third of the world&rsquo;s nations
                            will have catastrophically low levels of water,&rdquo; he said.
                            &ldquo;Encouraging change in consumption patterns and in increasing access to
                            water supply and sanitation is also a matter of developmental common sense,
                            since both yield very high rates of return, making them extremely attractive
                            from a social investment standpoint.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>The Vatican representative pointed to the reality of global warming and
                            its relation to the burning of fossil fuels and the use of other pollutants.
                            &ldquo;We can no longer pretend that human activity has little or no
                            impact&rdquo; on the worldwide &ldquo;changing climatic conditions,&rdquo; he
                            said.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;The Earth&rsquo;s climate system has demonstrably changed on both
                            global and regional scales since the pre-industrial era,&rdquo; Archbishop
                            Migliore said. &ldquo;Even if greenhouse gas emissions were to be stabilized
                            at present levels &ndash; an unlikely eventually as things stand &ndash; the
                            global warming trend and sea-level rise would continue for hundreds of years,
                            due to the atmospheric lifetime of some greenhouse gases and the long
                            timescales on which the deep ocean adjusts to climate change.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>While noting the &ldquo;legitimate priority needs of developing countries
                            for the achievement of sustained economic growth and the eradication of
                            poverty,&rdquo; the archbishop said that these goals &ldquo;cannot be
                            achieved at any price.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>The international community must transform its global energy systems from
                            traditional to renewable forms, he said. &ldquo;As current approaches are
                            causing serious harm to human health, the Earth&rsquo;s climate and
                            ecological systems on which all life depends,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the
                            development of renewables continues to be a human, ecological, economic and
                            strategic necessity and should have a priority in public research
                            projects.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>With more than 1.6 billion people lacking access to electricity,
                            &ldquo;improving access to reliable, affordable and environmentally friendly
                            energy services is a major challenge to poverty eradication,&rdquo;
                            Archbishop Migliore added.</p>
                        <p>He singled out the combustion engine as the engine behind the large
                            proportion of worldwide energy consumption, and major source of air pollution
                            and greenhouse gas emissions, urging its &ldquo;long overdue&rdquo;
                            replacement with &ldquo;clean, renewable alternatives.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Sustainable patterns,&rdquo; he said, are &ldquo;essential to our
                            common future.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;The dovetailing of environmental and developmental concerns with
                            commercial and industrial policymaking will surely lead to a safer, more
                            prosperous future for all,&rdquo; he added.</p>

                        <p>Thank you for this article. Perhaps our view of life is skewed. If we could be content with
                            less, and enjoy little things in this world, instead of always wanting more, then maybe we
                            can start to work towards reducing the awful burden industrialized countries have put on our
                            Earth. We are all in this together. My prayer is that we all, bit by bit, start to see that
                            we need to work together to harmonize our needs instead of our wants with each other.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks

                    and religious news, events,
