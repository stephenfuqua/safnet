                    <div class="lead">
                        <p>The question &quot;where are the youth?&quot; is one I have often heard at
                            interfaith gatherings. As one who is still considered amongst the youth
                            (though well into my career), I often feel this myself. At
                            recent gatherings I have taken to looking around the room, wondering who
                            amongst the participants will still be around in 10, 20 years. The interfaith
                            movement only has as much potential as it has human resources. On the other
                            hand, how many of my distinguished older colleagues were involved in
                            interfaith work in their youth? They are there now, and I have faith that
                            left to their own devices, an equal number of today&#39;s young people will
                            turn to interfaith work once they get past the prime of their
                            career-building, courtship, and parenting years. Still, interfaith groups
                            need to be developing their young leadership today. In a recent edition of
                            his <em>Sightings</em> project, Martin E. Marty from the University of
                            Chicago Divinity School continues on this theme.</p>

                    <p class="author">By Martin E. Marty<br />

                    <div class="entry">
                        <p>CHI, May 11 (UPI) &mdash; War-making takes its toll of young men and
                            women. Agents of conflict, prejudice, intolerant acts, defaming, defacing,
                            and hatred come in all sizes and ages, not least of all among the cohort of
                            collegiates, young singles, and young marrieds.</p>
                        <p>As for the other side: Among agents of peace-making, reconciliation,
                            positive dealings with others, tolerant acts, and the like &mdash; where are
                            the young? Look out from the platform, as I sometimes do, or at the back of
                            heads when I am in the audience, and the vision will be of mainly
                            silver-haired women and post-haired men in their sixties and up. They ask,
                            where are the young?</p>
                        <p>Numbers of excuses are given for the absence of the younger generations in
                            interfaith causes. First, you have to care about faith to &quot;do&quot;
                            interfaith, and many don&#39;t care. Second, the framing of issues was done
                            some time ago by people who are now old; that framing doesn&#39;t match what
                            the young are thinking. Third, the young are busy shaping careers and making
                            personal life decisions. They do not have the time that retirees or
                            still-employed seniors have. Fourth, they do not pay much attention to world
                            affairs, do not read newspapers, are ignorant of news, and watch reality TV,
                            not realistic TV. Fifth, they are cynical, unready to care about positive
                            actions since, they think, it doesn&#39;t pay.</p>
                        <p>One can provide counter evidence for some of these, but enough of the
                            generalizations hold that serious citizens must care about how to change the
                            situation. Here&#39;s where this week&#39;s sighting comes in. The Interfaith
                            Youth Core (IFYC) in late April sponsored community actions in thirty sites
                            worldwide, attracting 4,000 leaders, all young but diverse; &quot;Christian,
                            Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Baha&#39;i, Jain, and Sikh,&quot; at least,
                            took part. They were involved across the lines of faiths, cultures, and
                            nations in interfaith conversation and cooperative services of many sorts.
                            This was the third annual National Days of Interfaith Youth Service.</p>
                        <p>I have come to know a founder, if not the founder, of IFYC &mdash; Eboo
                            Patel of Chicago, who, with Patrice Brodeur, corralled a score of writers to
                            treat many aspects of youth service work, and published &quot;Building the
                            Interfaith Youth Movement&quot; (see below for more information).
                            Harvard&#39;s Diana Eck, perhaps too hopefully and a bit hyperbolically
                            &mdash; but I hope she&#39;s right &mdash; says this book &quot;is the first
                            fruits of a revolution, the most important and ultimately consequential
                            revolution of our time: the interfaith revolution.&quot; She and others
                            describe the Core activities and reflect on them. The IFYC leaders are not
                            wishy-washy &quot;we&#39;re all the same despite the names of our
                            faiths&quot; sorts, but help young people draw on the great traditions.</p>
                        <p>The book, edited by Eboo Patel and Patrice Brodeur is called
                            &quot;Building the Interfaith Youth Movement: Beyond Dialogue to
                            Action&quot;.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
