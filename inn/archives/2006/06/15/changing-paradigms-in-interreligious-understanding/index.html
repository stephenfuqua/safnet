                            republish a presentation he recently made at the Connecticut Council for
                            Interreligious Understanding. He begins with a beautiful vision of children
                            from all over the world playing together. With that peaceful meditation in
                            mind, he addresses the nature of interfaith dialogue, delving into and
                            explicating four different types of dialogue that he identifies as Dialogue
                            of Life, Dialogue of Action, Dialogue of Contemplation, Dialogue of
                            Theological Reflection.</p>

                        <p>I have a plaque on my desk that says <strong>&quot;Faith is knowing that
                                there is an ocean because you&#39;ve seen a brook.&quot;</strong> If the
                            ocean is that playground that you visualized, or that prayer about nation not
                            raising sword against nation, you who are in this room is the brook. Because
                            I&#39;ve seen this, I can imagine that.</p>
                        <p>I want to say how good it is to be in the shadow of Hartford Seminary. I
                            don&#39;t have to tell you about the incredible value the Seminary and its
                            MacDonald Center, under Professor Jane Smith&#39;s leadership is to you here
                            in Connecticut, but let me tell you that it has provided cutting edge
                            leadership to Christians in relations with Muslims.</p>
                        <p>Our two institutions, the NCC and Hartford Seminary have had a strong
                            relationship over the years. Only a couple of months ago, we did two pilot
                            events for our brand new joint project, one here at the seminary and the
                            other in New York at Union Seminary. &quot;God Is One: The Way of Islam&quot;
                            is a text book on Islam for Christians written by Hartford&#39;s own Marston
                            Speight. We are encouraging churches to use its six week long adult education
                            curriculum in their churches, and Hartford&#39;s Islamic scholars who are
                            Muslims themselves are training those who will teach those classes. We&#39;ve
                            had at least two churches that have completed the class already and I know of
                            another planning to do so this summer. If this project succeeds, I am hoping
                            that in 10 years, we would have done this training in hundreds of local
                            communities across this country, and as Christians learn about Islam, improve
                            their attitudes about Muslims and churches and Mosques build relationships,
                            there would be sea change in the way Americans view Muslims and Islam. I
                            don&#39;t have to tell you, you know why this is important.</p>
                        <p>I work for the National Council of Churches, an organization of 35
                            Christian denominations &hellip; Protestant, Anglican and Orthodox, who are
                            members of the organization. And these denominations represent over 100,000
                            churches across the US. That we have such a table where Churches seeped in
                            ancient traditions come together to forge a common agenda is itself a
                            miracle. Can you imagine Armenian Orthodox sitting next to the Society of
                            Friends, or Historic African American Churches together with Malankara Syrian
                            Orthodox Church!</p>
                        <p>Perhaps the most fundamental ecumenical principle that keeps churches that
                            are so different from each other working together is called the Lund
                            Principle: <strong>&quot;We will act together in all matters except those in
                                which deep differences of conviction compel us to act
                                separately.&quot;</strong> It is a commitment that affirms the value of the
                            common table, but at the same time affirms the distinctives and differences
                            of the individual communions. This has been the primary paradigms for
                            creating and sustaining the ecumenical table. Having come together, this
                            Community of Communions works to engage the churches and the larger public in
                            areas such as justice, peace, mobilizing against poverty and ecological
                            concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Last year addressing a gathering of 130 religious leaders in conference
                            called &quot;A Critical Moment in Interfaith Dialogue&quot; Dr. Samuel Kobia,
                            the General Secretary of the World Council of Churches said that it is time
                            that we take the same Lund Principle that characterizes the ecumenical
                            movement to the interfaith movement. That <strong>&quot;We will act together
                                in all matters except those in which deep differences of conviction compel us
                                to act separately.&quot;</strong> I appreciate that coming from him. For a
                            long time I have maintained that the word &quot;ecumenical&quot; itself
                            should not be limited to the Christian ecumenical project. The word
                            &quot;ecumenical&quot; derives from the Greek &quot;oikumene&quot; meaning
                            the &quot;household of God&quot; or the entire world. It is a word with much
                            broader meaning than the ones Christians are giving it. Although I won&#39;t
                            use the word to refer to interfaith contexts because that would create all
                            kinds of confusion, I hope we can use the principle to describe the
                            interfaith table as well. We will act together in matters except those things
                            in which deep differences of conviction compel as to act separately.</p>
                        <p>Someone said that there are two movements in the world these days:
                            globalization and interfaith. Indeed, the world is going interfaith. We are
                            in the midst of a paradigm shift. I believe, and I hope the systems theorists
                            among us will agree that the opposition we see by those who pull back toward
                            political unilateralism, cultural homogeneity and religious exclusivism is a
                            sign of a systemic pullback toward homeostasis that confirms this hypothesis.
                            A paradigm shift, as you know, is a different way of looking at the same
                            realities. I want to share with you the excitement I feel about this paradigm
                            shift.</p>
                        <p>First, it used to be that religious leaders would initiate this
                            interreligious conversation. Now, it&#39;s the governments that are bringing
                            religious leaders to the table. I&#39;ve just returned from Kazakhstan where
                            I was a group of religious leaders helping them to prepare for a religious
                            leaders summit in September. They are trying to set up its new capital Astana
                            as a City of Peace. And they think that the way to do solidify it is to get
                            interfaith dialogue to be at the center. Notice: this is the government of
                            Kazakhstan, which, as a part of the Soviet Union, just 16 years ago, was
                            officially hostile to religion.</p>
                        <p>Then as you probably know, the United Nations has now engaged in an
                            initiative called Alliance among Civilizations (it used to be called Dialogue
                            among Civilizations). Among its chief proponents is the government of the
                            Philippines. A recent headline in Philippine newspapers read interfaith
                            dialogue is the best solution to terrorism. &quot;Faith is the greatest
                            antidote to terrorism,&quot; said President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and urged
                            religious leaders to reach out across cultural and religious barriers. What
                            they are doing is just as important as building up military forces to fight
                            terrorism and injustice across the globe, she said. In the Philippines, the
                            &quot;vestiges of conflict in Mindanao are finally fading away&quot; due to
                            interfaith dialogue, Arroyo said.</p>
                        <p>Not only governments, business leaders are interested in the conversation.
                            Already this year I&#39;ve had two meetings with top business leaders who are
                            wanting be engaged with interfaith relations. A group called Young
                            Presidents&#39; Organization comprises CEOs of major corporations who are
                            under 50 years of age. These people with successful businesses and lots of
                            money are sick of the extremist rhetoric. Their Peace Action Network brought
                            together 8 religious leaders: Jewish, Muslim and Christian to ask us about
                            how to promote interfaith relations, how to reduce the extremist rhetoric in
                            the media because that&#39;s what&#39;s good for business.</p>
                        <p>Another group of business leaders who are Christians, said to a group of
                            religious leaders, we&#39;ve tried to bring our Christian values to our
                            business. Its hard, because, someone said, businesses have one purpose
                            &hellip; and that is to make money. There is no second purpose. At 4
                            o&#39;clock in the afternoon we have to make sure that the stock is going up,
                            one said, if not there will be other repercussions, like lay offs and the
                            future of the company might be at stake. In the midst of that we&#39;ve tried
                            to bring Christian values to our business practices. But then we look around
                            and people on our boards, people in senior management and people who are
                            ordinary workers are Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, Baha&#39;is and so on,
                            and we have to ask, what are their values and we don&#39;t know. One
                            gentleman got up and said, I am now 84. My time is gone, but I think about
                            how things will be 20 years from now. What do we know about religion and
                            values of people in India and China? We need you to help us find figure this
                            out!</p>
                        <p>Not only these: educators, health care workers, politicians, police and
                            fire departments are now the ones calling religious leaders to the table.
                            That&#39;s a significant change. At a recent meeting at the UN, some
                            religious leaders began to think through this change in paradigm. How do we
                            avoid being co-opted by the political or governmental interests we asked?</p>
                        <p>In our work of Interfaith Relations, we commonly refer to four types of
                            dialogue.. Dialogue of Life: where people try to relate to their neighbors,
                            sharing their joys and sorrows, and being challenged by and celebrating that
                            diversity. Dialogue of Action: where people of faith come together to out of
                            concern for their neighbors, to provide humanitarian aid for those in need,
                            to work on advocacy issues or to agitate against injustice and for human
                            liberation. Dialogue of Contemplation: is when persons, rooted in their own
                            religious traditions share their spiritual riches with each other, through
                            prayer and meditation, reading each other&#39;s scriptures or participating
                            in rituals, sometimes even doing interfaith services &hellip; like
                            Thanksgiving services. Dialogue of Theological Reflection: where people of
                            different religious traditions come together for conversation, seeking to
                            deepen their understanding of each other&#39;s faith stories, religious
                            heritages, scriptures and spiritual values. Let me describe these briefly and
                            identify for you the some new questions that lead us to this paradigm
                            shift.</p>
                        <h2>Dialogue of Life</h2>
                        <p>I don&#39;t have to tell you: people of other religions are our neighbors.
                            Even though this demographic shift in the US is relatively new &hellip; large
                            scale immigrations began only after 1965, religious plurality is not new,
                            even in this country, before our Christian fore-parents came to these shores,
                            there was a great plurality of religions in this continent and they still
                            survive. Some people look at that and are thrilled to see the richness that
                            these diverse immigrants and religious people bring to this country. But
                            others are afraid. And after 9/11 their fears are compounded, and of course
                            we have a government that wants to play on those fears. Here are some are
                            real questions that Christians have raised with me in my pastoral practice of
                            over 25 years.</p>
                        <p>I am going to surgery. My surgeon is a Bangladeshi Muslim and prays to
                            Allah before she does surgery. If she is praying to God, then I am happy. But
                            if she is praying to another God, can I trust her to do it right?</p>
                        <p>My son&#39;s Social Studies teacher is a Buddhist. He came home one day
                            saying that Buddhism is very attractive to him and that he is going to a
                            meditation class. Is this man trying to proselytize my son?</p>
                        <p>My daughter is going out with a young man from a Hindu family. He is a
                            fine young man, but his family is very religious. They have a special place
                            in their house set up for God statues and they burn incense there every night
                            and say prayers. It seems creepy to me.
                            Some people in the neighborhood came to my door asking me to sign a
                            petition. Some Muslims have gone to the Town Council to ask for zoning to
                            build a mosque. The petition is to oppose that. It says the mosque is a front
                            for a terrorist training center.</p>
                        <p>Now, here the new question that we need to struggle with. In these
                            situations, is the real question religion, or ethnicity? In other words, how
                            much are our racial prejudices at play here. This is a question we
                            haven&#39;t asked as clearly as we should have.</p>
                        <p>Here&#39;s an example: The recent cartoon controversy and the current
                            immigration debate. I have just finished writing an article to a religion
                            journal about Christian responses to the cartoon controversy. The really
                            interesting thing about those responses was that those Christians who have
                            had long standing relationships with Muslims understood at some depth the
                            pain that Muslims were feeling about this. Those who didn&#39;t and I
                            criticized, both the Danish council of Churches and the European Evangelical
                            Alliance particularly for the way their statements were patronizing and even
                            offensive to Muslims. US Evangelical Christians were confrontational. There
                            were at least two critical questions, I suggested that Christians should have
                            taken into consideration. One the publication of those cartoons was
                            deliberately provocative &hellip; remember that they refused to publish
                            caricatures of Jesus. Two, that it needs to be seen in the context of growing
                            Islamophobia in Europe and in the United States. My challenge to them is that
                            they cannot allow the Christian commitment to anti-racism to take a back seat
                            to freedom of speech. We&#39;ve begun to ask, if one of the real difficulties
                            of creating this table is one of racism, rather than religion.</p>
                        <h2>Dialogue of Action</h2>
                        <p>In local communities, Interfaith Councils have formed to create food
                            pantries, development organizations, and do community organizing. This is one
                            of the more exciting things I&#39;ve done: organizing interfaith communities
                            to engage in neighborhood actions.</p>
                        <p>We learned that the powers that be have an interest in keeping us divided
                            in to religious and racial communities. We discovered that if we stood
                            together we were had power to accomplish much. If it was a matter of putting
                            up a stop sign in a neighborhood corner or closing down a local drug house,
                            or lobbying the State legislature and lobby for equitable school funding,
                            small victories led to bigger victories.</p>
                        <p>The immigration protests these days remind me of those days. If the people
                            who protest look like those in this room, white, black, Asian, Latino,
                            there&#39;s great power in that. For a long time it was difficult to get
                            African Americans and Latinos to come together. But Jesse Jackson is out to
                            change that reality. He&#39;s been outspoken about the immigration question.
                            Writing recently in the Chicago Sun-Times, he addressed his African American
                            constituency. Its time African American joined that struggle he said.
                            &quot;Si se puede&quot; (Yes, we can) the slogan of the Latino immigrant
                            movement, he said is the new &quot;We shall overcome.&quot;</p>
                        <p>Here&#39;s the question to struggle with as we move forward. Religious
                            people are motivated by faith. But there are lots of activists who say they
                            are not religious, but they are our best allies. What&#39;s going on here?
                            How can we dialogue with those of &quot;no faith&quot; that we often work
                            with in causes of justice? Or is there another way to think about
                            &quot;faith.&quot; For instance, if faith is knowing that there is an ocean
                            because you have seen a brook &hellip; in other words, if faith is being able
                            to visualize a new world and work towards it, are there people who call
                            themselves non-religious, also people of faith? And then, if we think
                            differently about &quot;faith&quot; would we be able to find a commonality
                            between religious traditions that has been evading us?</p>
                        <h2><strong>Dialogue of Religious Experience</strong></h2>
                        <p>Sometimes local communities want to come together in prayer and worship.
                            Many communities now have Thanksgiving services. But can Christians and
                            Hindus worship together? What are some guidelines as we think about how to do
                            this? Very recently the Christian Conference of Connecticut (my colleague Dr.
                            Steve Sidorak sent it to me) adopted a document called, &quot;Together We
                            Pray: Ecumenical Guidelines for Christians Participating in Interreligious
                            Prayer and Worship&quot; It&#39;s a great document with practical suggestions
                            and I commend that to you.</p>
                        <p>Not only are people seeking ways to pray or worship together with
                            neighbors of other religions, but we are taking up other&#39;s religious
                            practices. For instance, these days more and more Christians are taking up
                            Yoga, Tai Chi and various meditation practices. My friend Father Tom Ryan has
                            written books about how Christians ought to do this.</p>
                        <p>However, there&#39;s a problem about this that we haven&#39;t usually
                            addressed. When we undertake another&#39;s spiritual practice, we take tend
                            to take the practice part of it, and insert different spiritual content into
                            it. So for instance, Christians have tended to undertake meditation, like
                            Buddhists do, but insert Christian content into the meditative reflection.
                            Although people tend to benefit from such exercises, there is something not
                            quite right about that. Meditation in the Buddhist or Hindu traditions has a
                            specific salvific purpose. In other words, it is meant to lead to a
                            specifically religious goal. The new question we are now considering is this:
                            what if we don&#39;t put our own religious content into another&#39;s
                            practice. What if we used the practice with the content with which it was
                            originally connected? So, if I as a Christian want to use Buddhist meditative
                            practices, what if I meditated on the things that Buddhists meditate on? Or,
                            if I were a Hindu and want to pray like the Muslims do, what if I don&#39;t
                            simply follow the practice of prostrating myself in prayer, but do actually
                            begin to pray to Allah who is One and affirm the teaching of the Prophet?
                            These are the new questions we are beginning to grapple with. In other
                            worlds, rather than undertake other&#39;s religious practices piecemeal, can
                            we undertake them with the full knowledge of what we are doing?</p>
                        <h2><strong>Dialogue of Theological Reflection</strong></h2>
                        <p>For the longest time, we thought that all that was meant by Interfaith
                            Dialogue was when religious scholars got together to think through
                            theological and philosophical questions from our religious traditions. Slowly
                            we began to realize that all these other kinds of dialogue are also taking
                            place at the same time. Ecumenical Christians have been working on building
                            dialogue tables for several decades now where scholars have come to the table
                            to dialogue on concepts in their religious traditions that may be similar or
                            different to those of other traditions. Along the way we&#39;ve learned many
                            lessons that are published in a booklet entitled &quot;
                            <a href="http://www.wcc-coe.org/wcc/what/interreligious/glines-e.html">Ecumenical
                                Considerations: For Dialogue and Relations with People of Other
                                Religions</a>.&quot;
                        </p>
                        <p>A new era in the dialogue of theological reflection is now starting.
                            Christians are asking, for instance, if it is theologically appropriate for
                            us to do our theologizing in the presence and engagement of people of other
                            religions. We&#39;ve noticed that had we done our interpretations of the
                            passion narratives in the presence of Jews, we may have been more alert to
                            the misconceptions that have caused so much grief and suffering. So we are
                            also asking the converse question, is there something inadequate about
                            Christian theology that is done without the presence and engagement of people
                            of other religions. If we say yes to that question, we will have to rethink a
                            lot of our theology.</p>
                        <p>I participate in an on-going group convened by the World Council of
                            Churches, called &quot;Thinking Together,&quot; a group of international
                            scholars who are themselves practitioners of several different religious
                            traditions. Because we have Buddhists present, we can&#39;t call it
                            theologizing together. We have finished one project on our how our religious
                            traditions view &quot;The Other,&quot; and now we are working on how our
                            religious traditions think about &quot;Conversion.&quot; Hindus, Jews,
                            Muslims and Buddhists who are part of the &quot;Thinking Together&quot; group
                            think that this would be a new direction on how our traditions will begin to
                            interpret their sacred scriptures and engage their theological
                            traditions.</p>
                        <p>These are some of the new questions and directions that point to the
                            change in paradigm. The point is to get to the visualization that we began
                            with &hellip; the prayer that &quot;nation shall not lift up sword against
                            nation&quot; and children from different nations and religions on the same
                            playground. That&#39;s the ocean. Yes, its hard to think that we will ever
                            get to the ocean, but I have faith that we will. For no other reason, than I
                            have seen the brook. And the brook is right here in this room.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
