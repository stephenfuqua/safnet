                            The Inter Religious Campaign Against Malaria in Mozambique, working with the
                            Washington National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., USA, was recently awarded
                            a major grant to fight malaria from the U.S. Agency for International Development

                        <p>Officials of the U.S. Agency for International Development announced Thursday
                            major funding to combat malaria in Mozambique, Malawi, Senegal, and Rwanda.
                            The funds, granted as part of the President&#8217;s Malaria Initiative (PMI),
                            are part of a five year $1.2 billion program for malaria prevention and treatment
                            throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Similar funds have already been allocated to
                            Angola, Tanzania and Uganda.</p>
                        <p>Bishop Dom Dinis Sengulane, Anglican Bishop of Lebombo, Mozambique, spoke at
                            the announcement on a panel entitled Fighting Malaria in Africa: Challenges
                            and Partnerships. He is working closely with Washington National Cathedral&#8217;s
                            Center for Global Justice and Reconciliation which supports the Inter Religious
                            Campaign against Malaria in Mozambique (IRCMM). The IRCMM is co-chaired by Bishop
                            Sengulane along with the Christian Council of Mozambique and Roman Catholic,
                            Muslim, Seventh-day Adventist and Assembly of God leaders.</p>
                        <p>Long known as a peacemaker (he negotiated the peace between the Frelimo government
                            and the Renamo rebels in 1992), Bishop Sengulane has focused his recent efforts
                            on integrating the church into issues of economic justice, including health
                            and education. &#8220;Before creating human beings, God who is a good mathematician,
                            started by putting on the ground the resources necessary to their survival,&#8221;
                            he says. &#8220;The principal reason of the poverty of our populations is thus
                            primarily the bad distribution of these riches.&#8221;</p>
                        <p>With malaria killing an African child every 30 seconds, prevention and treatment
                            of this mosquito-born disease is imperative. Bishop Sengulane says religious
                            organizations can play a pivotal role, &#8220;If we pool our resources, the
                            faith community can reach all over the country. We are in every village all
                            over the country. We go where government cannot go&#8221;.</p>
                        <p>Twenty-six Christian, Muslim and other faith leaders came together in Maputo,
                            Mozambique on April 19, 2006 to formalize their commitment to collaborate against
                            malaria and to establish the Inter Religious Campaign against Malaria in Mozambique.
                            Co-Chairs of the IRCMM are leaders of the Christian Council of Mozambique comprising
                            22-member churches, which includes Anglicans, United Methodists, Presbyterian
                            Churches, Seventh-day Adventist Church, Roman Catholic Church, the Assemblies
                            of God, the Islamic Congress of Mozambique, and the Islamic Council of Mozambique.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Mouzinho Saide, Mozambique&#8217;s health director said on April 19, 2006,
                            in Maputo, &#8220;Civil society has the responsibility to participate in the
                            communication efforts to change attitudes towards malaria. Specifically we expect
                            religious leaders to use their knowledge and spiritual power in helping transform
                            the efforts of the struggle against malaria in a way that is culturally appropriate
                            for our people&#8221;.</p>
                        <p>All 26 religious leaders signed a statement that reads:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>&#8220;We, Mozambican Religious Leaders Met at the S. Cipriano School on
                                April 19, 2006, in the context of the celebration of the Africa Malaria Day
                                (25 April). We are deeply shocked for the continuing loss of human lives in
                                the country due to malaria. Having in mind our communities&#8217; sensibilities
                                inside and outside the country, with regard to the protection of human lives
                                put by God in Mozambique, we commit ourselves to strengthen the fight against
                                malaria as Mozambican citizens, and also as God-fearing men and women.&#8221;</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>The religious leaders then committed to mobilizing resources to support various
                            actions in prevention, treatment and research.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hassan Makda, chair of the Mozambique Islamic Congress and co-chair of
                            the IRCMM, says that issues of social justice can be addressed by religious
                            organizations without being &#8220;religious.&#8221; &#8220;Malaria does not
                            discriminate between Muslims and Christians. Our whole society suffers when
                            Mozambican children and pregnant women die. We embrace collaboration with other
                            faiths against malaria. Working together against the common problem of malaria
                            binds us also in other ways.&#8221;</p>
                        <p>Bishops Sengulane and Mr. Makda called a Working Group to action in support
                            of their efforts to urgent action on March 16, 2006. Members of the Working
                            Group include the United Methodist Church, Seventh-day Adventist Church, Episcopal
                            Relief and Development, Catholic Medical Mission Board, Population and the Friends
                            of Charities Association.</p>
                        <p>Advisors to the Working Group include Centers for Disease Control, National
                            Institutes of Health, UN Foundation, and USAID. The Working Group is convened
                            and staffed by the Washington National Cathedral&#8217;s Center for Global Justice
                            and Reconciliation. The Center, which operates under the auspices of the National
                            Cathedral&#8217;s Cathedral College, is organized to promote global justice
                            and reconciliation through inter religious and ecumenical collaboration. Drawing
                            upon the biblical imperative to end poverty as a requirement for justice, the
                            Center forges partnerships among Christian denominations, with interfaith partners,
                            governments, NGOs and the private sector to address the root causes of human
                            suffering.</p>
                        <p>General Secretary of the Lutheran World Federation Dr. Ishmael Noko, who was
                            among the leaders of the September 2005 Consultation on Global Poverty calling
                            for interfaith partnership to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, reiterates
                            the importance of collaboration. &#8220;This commitment to pool capacities and
                            resources for humanitarian relief of suffering from malaria is exactly the kind
                            of interfaith partnership we imagined when we called for urgent action by the
                            worldwide faith community in the &#8216;Call to Partnership&#8217; consensus
                            document delivered to the UN General Assembly on the eve of its opening meeting.&#8221;</p>
                        <p>&#8220;Speaking from a public health perspective, and as a member of the Working
                            Group to support IRCMM, I am tremendously hopeful that by combining the extensive
                            congregational resources of the various faith communities we can make a significant
                            and lasting impact on malaria in Mozambique,&#8221; remarked Dr. Allan Handysides,
                            Director of Health Ministries of the World Seventh-day Adventist Church.</p>
                        <p>Among the Center&#8217;s current priorities is forging inter religious collaborations
                            to address the scourge of malaria. Although preventable, malaria is the leading
                            cause of death throughout the world. Closer collaboration between religious
                            centers, health organizations, and government programs will increase the effectiveness
                            and reach of anti-malaria programs. The Center has established an Inter Religious
                            Working Group on Malaria and was considered by many to be instrumental in assisting
                            Mozambique in gaining anti-malaria funding.

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks

                    and religious news, events,
