                    <div class="lead">
                        <p>On the first day of spring, March 21, Charles, Prince of Wales, spoke to a gathering at the
                            University of Al Azhar in Egypt. He speech focused on the commonalities of Judaism,
                            Christianity, and Islam &#8212; all based in the Abrahamic traditions &#8212; and the need
                            for all parties to look deeply at their understanding of the other, (re) learning to
                            appreciate the strength of each and the examples history has for us of fruitful
                            collaboration between the three. </p>

                    <p class="postdate">March 21, 2006</p>
                    <div class="entry">
                        <p><a id="more-136"></a>
                        <p>I </p>
                        <p>Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have been enormously
                            touched that you should have considered inviting me to speak at this
                            most venerable and ancient place of worship and learning. You have
                            done me the greatest honour through your invitation, and indeed
                            through conferring this much treasured honorary doctorate on me, and
                            I count it a very special privilege to visit the University of Al
                            Azhar and, indeed, to return to Egypt &ndash; a country for which I have a
                            particular affection and which, for many, has a sacred significance
                            as the place of refuge for the child Jesus.</p>
                        <p>I would like to begin by paying tribute to the man who first
                            encouraged me to accept the invitation to speak here, a dear friend
                            and graduate of this great university, Shaikh Zaki Badawi. His
                            sudden death in January was a profound shock and an immense sadness
                            to many of us across the world. He was a man of real wisdom and
                            learning. With the humility of a true scholar, he made his great
                            knowledge accessible to others &ndash; and did so with an irresistible
                            sense of humour. I am so pleased and proud that his widow Lady
                            Badawi is with us for this occasion. </p>
                        <p>I do not claim to be a scholar, other than having studied history at
                            the University of Cambridge &ndash; not quite as old as this one, but I do
                            have a great interest in exploring the Abrahamic tradition into which
                            I was born. This tradition has shaped me and made me who I am.
                            Today I stand before you as one belonging to the family of faiths
                            connected by that tradition.</p>
                        <p>II </p>
                        <p>The roots of the faith that we share in the One God, the God of
                            Abraham, give us enduring values. We need the courage to speak of
                            them and affirm them again and again to a world troubled by change
                            and dissension. That is the message which, above all, I wish to
                            leave you with today. First, and highest among those values of our
                            common inheritance, and born of our love of God, must always come
                            respect for each other, and for His creation. Our respect for all
                            God&#8217;s creatures and for the environment is the expression of our
                            respect for the Creator whose inspiration is the entire manifest
                            world.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, and following from this, our beliefs and values call out
                            for peace and not conflict. We may have a human weakness to
                            criticise and to compete with each other. But what we have in
                            common, as people of faith, calls us beyond this towards mutual
                            respect and understanding. </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, the great Abrahamic traditions speak of a faith which rests
                            in the heart beyond the limitations of our intellectual knowledge and
                            judgement. Wherever we are placed in our human society, whatever the
                            advantages or disadvantages we have in ability or education, we
                            perceive the truths of our faith with the `eye of the heart&#8217;. The
                            Prophet Moses reminded us that the heart is the seat of faith: &quot;Thou
                            shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart&quot; . I believe that
                            the great faiths speak through their sacred texts to the heart, and
                            that faith itself is heart-felt. </p>
                        <p>But while I cherish the connections within the history of our
                            different Abrahamic Faiths, I do not want you to imagine for one
                            moment that I think that they are one and the same. There are
                            differences, and we should celebrate them. But in the things that
                            matter most, we have a common root. In my view, God&#8217;s purpose should
                            never be in doubt: it is to bind us closer together! Unity through
                            diversity&hellip; Indeed, it has always moved me that the Holy Koran has a
                            verse: &quot;O Mankind! We created you from a single pair of a male and
                            a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that ye may know each
                            other (not that ye may despise each other).&quot; </p>
                        <p>III </p>
                        <p>I first voiced my thoughts publicly on relations between Islam and
                            the West in 1993, in a speech at another great university, Oxford.
                            Something I said then has troubled me ever since. I said:</p>
                        <p>&hellip;despite the advances in technology and mass communication in the
                            second half of the twentieth century, despite mass travel and the
                            intermingling of races&hellip;misunderstandings between Islam and the West
                            continue. Indeed they may be growing. </p>
                        <p>Tragically, the intervening twelve years have confirmed my fears and,
                            for so many, those years have been profoundly bleak. My heart is
                            heavy from witnessing the never-ending death and destruction &ndash; the
                            kind of death and destruction I understand only too well, having
                            experienced the loss of my beloved Great Uncle, Lord Mountbatten, at
                            the hands of terrorist bombers in 1979. Images of communities torn
                            apart by religious conflict are deeply harrowing &ndash; from Bosnia to
                            Baghdad, from Chechnya to Palestine &ndash; evidence of just how far
                            misunderstandings have continued and escalated. Violence, so often
                            justified in the name of religion, effects a terrible hardening of
                            hearts. What good can possibly come of all of this? </p>
                        <p>In that same speech, I talked about the history of Europe and the
                            Islamic world &ndash; how they were inextricably entwined, and how, through
                            the centuries, the giving and taking on both sides had contributed so
                            greatly to what we have become today. History shows what giant leaps
                            of creativity in knowledge &ndash; in science, literature and the arts &ndash;
                            have occurred when the members of the Abrahamic family have worked
                            together. Can we not draw inspiration from the great explosion of
                            knowledge and understanding which took place under the Abbassids
                            between the ninth and thirteenth centuries, when their capital
                            Baghdad was a world centre of learning; or from Islamic Spain between
                            the tenth and the fourteenth centuries, when in cities such as
                            Cordoba and Toledo, the work of Christian, Muslim and Jewish scholars
                            led to the flowering of the Renaissance? We need to remember that we
                            in the West are in debt to the scholars of Islam, for it was thanks
                            to them that during the Dark Ages in Europe the treasures of
                            classical learning were kept alive.</p>
                        <p>But in that same speech I also spoke of how, sadly, despite this
                            fertile flow of ideas, many on both sides had still been left with
                            uncompromising prejudices towards each other&#8217;s cultures. This
                            lingering mutual distrust persists, and with dreadful results. I
                            think of the experience of Muslims living in Europe who are subject
                            to varied and continuous expressions of Islamophobia by fellow-
                            Europeans. I think of Christians living within some Muslim nations,
                            who find themselves fettered by harsh and degrading restrictions, or
                            subject to abuse by some of their fellow-citizens. And I think of
                            dreadful acts of terrorism and violence across the world, carried out
                            in the distorted name of faith.</p>
                        <p>I believe with all my heart that responsible men and women must work
                            to restore mutual respect between faiths, and that we should do all
                            we can to overcome the distrust that poisons so many people&#8217;s lives.
                            This, of course, is made infinitely more difficult by the stereotypes
                            and absurdities propagated by certain sections of the Media. In my
                            own very modest way, through the work of my Prince&#8217;s Trust, my
                            Foundation for the Built Environment and my School of Traditional
                            Arts, I have sought to find ways to integrate communities and to
                            celebrate the virtues of Islamic cultures in the United Kingdom. As
                            these programmes develop across other countries, I hope that they may
                            serve as a model for communities elsewhere. Even from small projects
                            and examples the foundations of mutual respect, consideration and
                            courtesy can be rebuilt, sometimes through the physical design of
                            people&#8217;s surroundings &ndash; surroundings which can help to enhance our
                            shared humanity rather than treat us as technological adjuncts to the
                            increasingly mechanistic world around us.</p>
                        <p>IV </p>
                        <p>The legacy of misunderstanding and conflict between religions has had
                            a central role in the terrible history of war and violence. And none
                            more so, of course, than the truly apocalyptic cruelty and
                            destruction caused by the two unholy, secular &quot;religions&quot; of
                            Communism and Fascism. </p>
                        <p>Over the centuries, as societies have evolved, we can often see two
                            distinct reactions to this ruinous legacy. Some hold ever more
                            tightly to their religion, as a source of stability in their lives &ndash;
                            and, as conflicts rage, they identify other traditions only as
                            threats. Others become disenchanted with religion altogether; with
                            the whole concept of metaphysics and a dimension beyond ourselves.
                            They abandon any faith in God, and see religion itself
                            as &quot;backward,&quot; &quot;primitive&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot;. This disenchantment
                            and
                            indifference poses a danger for our inheritance of faith, universal
                            values and a living tradition. Coupled with an obsession with
                            materialism and trivia, it is a threat across the world, not least to
                            our own traditional Christian culture.</p>
                        <p>In Europe, it was partly in reaction to the apparently ceaseless wars
                            between different Christian denominations that many sincere people
                            came to think that if we could only create truly secular societies in
                            which the bigotry, violence and pedantry that people associated with
                            religion would disappear, the underlying sources of conflict would be
                            removed, and we would all get on better. They hoped that if, in the
                            place of institutionalized religion, the material wellbeing and
                            security of the people could be enhanced and protected through the
                            discoveries of science, then the march to harmony, progress and human
                            happiness would continue unopposed. </p>
                        <p>Inevitably, it has not turned out to be quite so easy. As we are
                            finding, scientific knowledge, which has brought us all so much that
                            we value and are privileged to take for granted, is not the same as
                            Wisdom. For it is Wisdom alone that can reveal to us those universal
                            and eternal truths that lie at the heart of all the great
                            traditions. In many people&#8217;s lives today these truths, which
                            provided our forefathers with a secure framework for their existence
                            and with a clear set of ethical values, have become obscured, have
                            disappeared entirely from their lives. This is not a phenomenon
                            peculiar to the West. We see it in each strand of the Abrahamic
                            faiths. </p>
                        <p>The implications of this loss run deep. For I believe that
                            moderation comes from the Wisdom passed down to us through
                            tradition. Extremism exploits our loss of respect for tradition.
                            Loss of religious certainty is pushing many to take refuge in new
                            absolutes which, like any primitive belief, tolerate no doubt or
                            reservation, but lead to various forms of extremism. </p>
                        <p>We need to recover the depth, the subtlety, the generosity of
                            imagination, the respect for Wisdom that so marked Islam in its great
                            ages. Islam called Jews and Christians the peoples of the book,
                            because they, like Muslims are a part of a religion of sacred texts:
                            the Koran, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament. And what was so
                            distinctive of the great ages of faith was that they understood that,
                            as well as sacred texts, there is the art of interpretation of sacred
                            texts &ndash; and this is a difficult and subtle art that gave rise in
                            Islam to great principles of interpretation and great schools of
                            jurisprudence.</p>
                        <p>Between the text and the meaning of the text &ndash; between the meaning of
                            God&#8217;s word for all time and its meaning for this time &ndash; falls the act
                            of interpretation. It was Islam&#8217;s greatness to understand this in
                            its full depth and challenge. And this is what you, at this great
                            and historic institution, can give not only to Islam, but, by
                            example, to all the other children of Abraham.</p>
                        <p>Today, too often, there seems to be a tendency to read texts as if
                            they needed no interpretation, as if we could read their meaning on
                            the surface. That does violence to the Divine word, and violence to
                            the word eventually leads to violence to the person, and to the
                            world. </p>
                        <p>When all we can hear in sacred texts is simple certainties, when all
                            we can see in God&#8217;s multicoloured world is black and white, we begin
                            to divide humanity into simple oppositions: the good and the evil;
                            the pious and the profane; us and the enemy. And this then leads to
                            hatred and violence. For it is then that we lose the single most
                            important principle that unites the Abrahamic faiths: in
                            Judaism, &quot;Love your neighbour as yourself&quot; ; in Christianity, &quot;All
                            things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye so to
                            them&quot; ; and in Islam &quot;No-one of you is a believer until he desires
                            for his brother that which he desires for himself&quot;.
                        </p>
                        <p>V </p>
                        <p>If we are to heed these teachings, to ensure that the voice of
                            moderation can continue to be heard, and to oppose extremism, what do
                            our understandings of God, implicit in our faiths, have to say that
                            might help us? First of all, the Good Lord surely does not mean us
                            to kill each other &ndash; that is in all our traditions. Secondly, in a
                            world of abstractions, materialism and loss of spiritual meaning,
                            surely those of us who share a faith in something beyond merely
                            ourselves, beyond the ego and the passions, beyond the worship of
                            science for its own sake, who have faith in a harmonious universe
                            that balances mind, body and spirit, the heart and the head, in an
                            understanding of the divine order that is God&#8217;s mysterious and loving
                            gift to the created world &ndash; surely, surely we should be uniting
                            together on the basis of our shared beliefs? Surely the wisdom I
                            have referred to earlier should warn us that far from fighting each
                            other, or arguing about futile abstractions, we should be working
                            together in the face of the immense environmental crisis threatening
                            our entire planet? What, then, can we learn from Islam that will
                            help us re-integrate ourselves with Nature? Can we not see the
                            urgent need before it is too late to blend the intuitive genius of
                            the East with the practical genius of the West? </p>
                        <p>Central to the teachings of all our faiths is an emphasis on respect
                            for each other. This is much more than a political argument about
                            the rights of minorities. Muslims, Christians and Jews are united in
                            believing in the dignity and value of the individual. Each of us is
                            unique and of unique value to God. When we know ourselves, our
                            frailties and weaknesses, we can see the importance of understanding
                            towards others &ndash; of seeing the other&#8217;s point of view.</p>
                        <p>Respect for others, and for what is precious to others &ndash; in other
                            words good manners, civility, and a willingness to listen &ndash; ensures
                            respect towards our own values and ideals. The recent ghastly strife
                            and anger over the Danish cartoons shows the danger that comes of our
                            failure to listen and to respect what is precious and sacred to
                            others. In my view, the true mark of a civilized society is the
                            respect it pays to minorities and to strangers. Generous, hospitable
                            welcome to strangers and to those on their travels is justifiably a
                            proud element of Arab culture. We in Britain have made great efforts
                            to welcome people of other faiths, and to enable them to preserve
                            their unique identities, while at the same time accommodating
                            themselves to British culture. There are now more than a million and
                            a half British Muslims. They enrich British society in countless
                            ways, as, I am sure, do the Christian minorities in Muslim nations. </p>
                        <p>As people of faith, we know, too, that the human spirit is called to
                            the horizon of eternity. We sense intuitively that we are too
                            frequently focussed on the external world, which so often discounts
                            what cannot be measured and weighed. But how can we measure or weigh
                            Faith, Beauty, Loyalty, Joy, or indeed Love itself &ndash; all the things
                            that make life worth living and help define the essence of our
                            humanity? Do not these qualities represent an inner reality? And,
                            when we speak of an inner reality, we are in fact speaking of that
                            dimension which sees beyond the material &ndash; in other words, we are
                            speaking once more of the heart. We speak metaphorically of the
                            heart as the source of compassion &ndash; the &quot;charity&quot; to which St. Paul
                            refers in one translation of the Bible &ndash; which, for Christians, is
                            the supreme virtue. </p>
                        <p>When we face problems of understanding between cultures and
                            religions, is not what is missing just that perception: the
                            perception of the heart which is kind, moderate and full of
                            acceptance? This is the perception in which we can all share and
                            which is brought to mind by the writings and example of the great
                            mystics in our different traditions &ndash; people like Julian of Norwich,
                            Rabbi Isaac Luria, and Imam Muhammad Idris al-Shafi. Do not these
                            great men and women, with their perennial wisdom, tell us of the need
                            to balance our often aggressive and superficial behaviour with a more
                            gentle, contemplative attitude &ndash; a turning from the head to that
                            domain of the heart where the goodness in our common humanity is to
                            be found? Let me be clear: this is not an argument about
                            contemplative withdrawal, but rather a prescription for active
                            engagement in our dealings with others. After all, we share together
                            a tradition of revelation that has informed the very essence of our
                            faiths. Interestingly, science is beginning to discover the order
                            and harmony inherent within Nature &ndash; something that was revealed to
                            the ancients thousands of years ago. Surely this indicates a
                            profound truth about the pattern of the inner life and its
                            relationship with God&#8217;s mysterious pattern for the manifested world?</p>
                        <p>VI </p>
                        <p>I believe we have a shared duty to speak for the principles of our
                            religious faiths. I believe we must protect the integrity of all our
                            traditions &ndash; Muslim, Christian and Jewish &ndash; acknowledging and
                            celebrating our rich diversity which, at the end of the day, is our
                            only guarantee against the domination of a uniform, monocultural,
                            global culture, whether religious or secular.</p>
                        <p>And I believe that, to defend the realm of the spirit against
                            materialism, and the transcendent dignity of each one of us against
                            extremism and self-idolatry, we must foster, encourage and act upon
                            that which embodies the divine attributes of mercy and compassion.
                            That calls for calmness and the exercise of restraint. And, if I may
                            say so, it requires all those who are in positions of authority in
                            our different faiths to preach clearly and consistently to others the
                            eternal value of these Divine attributes.</p>
                        <p>Some three thousand years ago King Solomon, the son of David,
                            said, &quot;Where there is no vision, the people perish&quot;. I can only say
                            that I look forward to a world in which we share a vision that
                            acknowledges our differences with respect and understanding; that
                            recognises what others hold sacred &ndash; and to a world in which we see
                            that we cannot, and must not, abuse our great traditions and their
                            teachings as a weapon in the service of selfish, worldly power. </p>
                        <p>I have no illusions about the difficulty of this task. But I believe
                            it is one which now, above all times, we must undertake, and
                            undertake together. There is no other way to preserve the innermost
                            values of our faiths which we hold most dear. We must work together
                            to create a world in which the fruits of faith &ndash; understanding,
                            tolerance and compassion &ndash; enrich and safeguard the world of our
                            children, and our children&#8217;s children. We must not let slip this
                            opportunity and this challenge in an age which requires our
                            determined, committed and heartfelt efforts to live in peace together.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
