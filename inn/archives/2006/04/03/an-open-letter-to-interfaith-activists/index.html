                        <p>A student at the American University in Washington, DC, Fait Mahdini, calls on interfaith
                            activists to do more to attract youth in their quest to counter messages of religious
                            intolerance and violence. In so doing, he outlines a vision of using the arts to inspire and
                            uplift the pluralistic message of interfaith activism, going beyond academic conferences and
                            statements of unity. </p>

                    <p class="author">By Fait Mahdini</p>

                    <div class="entry">
                        <p> Washington, DC - The opportunities for influencing public opinion and promoting peace and
                            mutual understanding are limitless in an age where the world is connected at the press of a
                            button or the touch of a keyboard, but those of us involved in the efforts for interfaith
                            dialogue and tolerance still face obstacles in making our voices heard. </p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, the same inter-connectedness that should unite us allows those who preach hate
                            and intolerance to spread their messages. Today, it is more important than ever for those of
                            us who support pluralism and interfaith cooperation to double our efforts to break through
                            the wall of images and sounds that surrounds us each day.</p>
                        <p>In this struggle for understanding, youth are our most important resource, and the group we
                            should all strive to reach. It is youth whose views and future actions will shape the world.
                            For this reason alone, our efforts to increase interfaith dialogue and cross-cultural
                            understanding must focus on them. In an increasingly complex world, young people are
                            sometimes overwhelmed and it is all too easy for the comforting, yet simplistic, messages of
                            rejection and intolerancet to reach them.</p>
                        <p>In order to combat messages of intolerance and strengthen cross-cultural understanding, we
                            must come up with more than academic conferences and symbolic demonstrations of unity to
                            reach the younger generations. In order to make a lasting impact, we must express our
                            message in ways that appeal to the interests of youth, for example through the use of the
                            visual arts, sport and music. We must think &ldquo;outside of the box&rdquo; in order to
                            promote interfaith understanding successfully. Let&rsquo;s face it: one sentence from the
                            mouth of a famous musician can have just as much power, influence and impact as the work of
                            an entire organisation devoted to interfaith dialogue.</p>
                        <p>Imagine entering a concert venue where you know you are among people from a wide range of
                            faiths, all there for a common cause - music and international peace and understanding.
                            Walking around before the show begins, you notice young Christians wearing the cross, Jewish
                            youth wearing skullcaps and a group of young Muslims, some wearing kufis (traditional
                            braided) and hijabs - different faiths gathered under one roof together to enjoy music and
                            camaraderie.</p>
                        <p>Outside the main hall you find hundreds of paintings, drawings and poetry exhibits
                            celebrating the diversity of the world&rsquo;s religions. Then, as the show begins,
                            thousands of young Christians, Jews and Muslims rise from their seats to watch as rappers
                            such as Mos Def , Common, Talib Kweli, Nas and Kanye West appear. Mos Def begins the concert
                            with a &ldquo;Bismillah ar-Rahman ar-Rahim&rdquo; (&ldquo;In the name of God, Most Gracious,
                            Most Merciful&rdquo;), which is then translated into English. Then, Common and Talib Kweli
                            take to their stage, filling the hall with their socially-conscious lyrics. As their deep
                            and introspective sound fills the hearts of listeners, you observe Nas, with a microphone in
                            his hand, preparing for his performance. He begins his performance sitting in a chair
                            (identical to the one from his well-known music video &ldquo;One Mic&rdquo;), and sings the
                            line &ldquo;God forgive me for my sin&#8230;&rdquo; He then goes into the song &ldquo;Just a
                            Moment&rdquo; which references Christian and Islamic scriptures.</p>
                        <p>As Nas winds down his performance, Kanye West&rsquo;s song begins, and the crowd goes wild.
                            Kanye begins singing over the sea of people, &ldquo;God, show me the way because the Devil
                            is trying to bring me down&rdquo;, a message that resonates with any God-fearing individual,
                            regardless of religion. Even Bono makes a special appearance - to sing U2&rsquo;s famous
                            anthem, &ldquo;Pride (In the name of love).&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>The music is flowing, the beat is rocking and the energy is electric, lively, and full of
                            hope. Most importantly, Christian, Jewish and Muslim youth are interacting, peacefully.
                            While bobbing their heads next to one other, they see people of other faiths enjoying the
                            same music. It is at that moment that they begin to dispel the stereotypes they have learned
                            from the media, or from religious or political leaders, about the &ldquo;other&rdquo;.</p>
                        <p>We have all been touched by a sound, a beat, a lyric, the hair on our arms rising as our
                            bodies and hearts become one. We might even be moved to tears. At such moments, we
                            understand the power of music, and how it can inspire thousands of people to live together
                            and to learn about and respect the beliefs of those different from them.</p>
                        <p>The positive energy produced by such a concert could affect the perspectives and opinions of
                            those who attend such a concert for the rest of their lives. A hundred interfaith dialogue
                            meetings could not replicate its power. You forget about that article you read a month ago,
                            or the names of the interfaith group speakers at that convention, but you would always
                            recall the night when some of the most popular musicians of our time came together on one
                            stage, making history by promoting a common cause.</p>
                        <p>And to all artists who have an understanding of the importance of interfaith tolerance and
                            acceptance, I ask you to join us, to consider this proposal, and to use your art in positive
                            ways to inspire and change the lives of the millions of youth who listen to your music, who
                            know every line to your songs, and who turn to you when they feel that the world is against
                            them. Let us work towards organising an interfaith concert that will encourage the youth of
                            the world to respect one another regardless of faith.</p>

                        <p>Yes Fait, as you said &#8220;Youth are our most important resource, and the group we should
                            all strive to reach. It is youth whose views and future actions will shape the world. For
                            this reason alone, our efforts to increase interfaith dialogue and cross-cultural
                            understanding must focus on them&#8221;. I agree with you 100% that we need to create the
                            platform for the youth and engage them on interfaith dialogue. Thank you for addressing this
                            issue. In Ethiopia our interfaith work(URI CC) is done mainly by the youth for the youth and
                            with the youth. They are quite active in it. May Peace Prevail on Earth

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
