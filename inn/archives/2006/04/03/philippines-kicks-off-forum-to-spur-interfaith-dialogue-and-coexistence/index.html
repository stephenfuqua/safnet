                        <p>Following on last year&#8217;s ground-breaking conference on Interfaith Cooperation for Peace
                            at the UN, which brought together members of governments, the UN, and NGOs, the Phillippine
                            Mission announced last week the creation of the Tripartite Forum on Interfaith Cooperation
                            for Peace. The launch event was attended by representatives from more than 60 nations, UN
                            departments, and civil society groups, including the five officers of the Committee of
                            Religious NGOs (Soka Gakkai International, Temple of Understanding, Religions for Peace,
                            Baha&#8217;is of the USA, United Religions Initiative).</p>

                    <p class="author">By AFP</p>
                    <div class="entry">
                        <p>UNITED NATIONS, March 24, 2006 (AFP) - Philippine Foreign Secretary Alberto
                            Romulo on Friday launched a partnership of governments, UN agencies and
                            civil society to back UN programs promoting interfaith dialogue and
                            peaceful coexistence.
                        </p>
                        <p>Speaking at a luncheon attended by the president of the UN General
                            Assembly, Jan Eliasson of Sweden, Romulo told the new tripartite Forum
                            aimed to vanquish intolerance by building on the increasing momentum behind
                            interfaith cooperation for peace.
                        </p>
                        <p>&quot;We must complement and mutually reinforce other initiatives, particularly
                            the Alliance of Civilizations,&quot; he told a luncheon also attended by several
                            ambassadors to the UN and officials of UN specialized agencies.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Alliance of Civilizations is a 2005 initiative by UN chief Kofi Annan
                            and the prime ministers of Spain and Turkey aimed at bringing together
                            institutions and civil society to bridge prejudices and misunderstandings
                            between peoples of different cultures and religions.
                        </p>
                        <p>&quot;Many of us have seen and felt the tragic consequences when terror and
                            conflict are fueled by those who exploit differences in faiths and
                            beliefs,&quot; Romulo said.
                        </p>
                        <p>&quot;But increasingly, all of us are fighting back, armed with the profound
                            resolve to build peace, understanding and tolerance by fostering dialogue
                            and cooperation among faiths, cultures and civilizations,&quot; he added.
                        </p>
                        <p>The apolitical forum is an outgrowth of a conference on Interfaith
                            Cooperation for Peace that was held here last June.
                        </p>
                        <p>The June parley was attended by representatives of 16 countries &#8211;
                            Argentina, Bangladesh, Ecuador, Gambia, Germany, Indonesia, Iran,
                            Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Morocco, Pakistan, Philippines, Senegal, Spain,
                            Thailand and Tunisia.
                        </p>
                        <p>It was also attended by the World Bank, UNESCO and religious
                            non-governmental organizations.
                        </p>
                        <p>Romulo said the Forum would hold a ministerial session on the sidelines of
                            the General Assembly session here later this year.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
