                    <div class="entry">
                        <p> Seville - Incidents of Islamophobia and anti-Semitism have seen an increase in the last few
                            years around the globe. The deteriorating relationship between Muslims and Jews has brought
                            about the necessity to bring religious leaders together to find solutions to the hatred and
                            misunderstanding that exist between the two communities. As the primary organization
                            dedicated to increasing Muslim-Jewish dialogue worldwide, we were honoured to represent
                            Children of Abraham at the Second World Congress of Imams and Rabbis for Peace in Seville,
                            Spain last week. </p>
                        <p>Many of us see the religious leaders as an obstacle to improved Muslim-Jewish relations, but
                            the organizers of the conference from Hommes de Parole &#8212; a French Foundation that
                            promotes dialogue and peaceful resolution between conflicting parties&#8211; know that the
                            &#8212; imams and rabbis must be brought into the action at this early stage. We applaud
                            their efforts to bring the crisis in Muslim-Jewish relations away from the margins towards
                            the power centres of the respective communities.</p>
                        <p>The Congress brought together rabbis and imams from all over Africa and Europe, as well as
                            from North America and Israel/Palestine. Noticeably absent were Muslim participants from the
                            Persian Gulf and Asia. Moreover, the decision by the organizers not to invite female rabbis
                            or female Muslim religious scholars made the gathering something of a &lsquo;bearded
                            men&rsquo;s club&rsquo;. Nevertheless, the gathering of these men was a historic achievement
                            and should be recognized as such. The imams and rabbis in attendance proved to the world
                            that it is possible to bring these two communities together to begin the process for us to
                            rejoice in our similarities and learn from our differences. One Moroccan-born Israeli rabbi
                            literally sang through the night with his Moroccan Muslim colleagues in a profound example
                            of the celebration of Muslim-Jewish co-existence.</p>
                        <p>Not surprisingly, one of the major sources of tension in Seville was voiced by the delegation
                            of twenty Palestinians from Gaza &ndash; who pleaded with their peers to put the issue of
                            Palestine &ndash; specifically the economic hardships they currently face &ndash; on the top
                            of the agenda. Shaking heads and rolling eyes could be seen around the room by the men in
                            black hats &ndash; many of whom clearly agreed to come to Seville with the confidence that
                            it would be a gathering to speak only about matters of religion.</p>
                        <p>Our view in Children of Abraham is that a middle road must be found for Muslim-Jewish
                            dialogue whereby the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is neither ignored nor dominant. It is
                            clearly the central source of tension in contemporary Muslim-Jewish relations. However, just
                            as most Muslims have their passion for Palestine and most Jews have their passion for
                            Israel, so we all have a complex religious identity that is severely skewed in the
                            conversations between our two communities that focus solely on the political situation in
                            Israel/Palestine. A tremendous amount of frustration was murmured in a clear display that
                            participants had very different reasons for coming together. Without a strong moderator to
                            keep plenary sessions focused, the choice was made to use an &lsquo;Open Space&rsquo; format
                            to allow participants to take ownership of the agenda by creating and moderating their own
                            workshops on a wide array of topics.</p>
                        <p>There was a focus on the importance of youth oriented programs in many speeches, but there
                            were no concrete examples cited to inspire confidence in the participants that such dialogue
                            had the chance of extending to the grassroots. The organizers, however, were kind enough to
                            sponsor two students from Children of Abraham &ndash; one from Jakarta and the other from
                            Tehran &ndash; both of whom had no imams in attendance. Meeting Jews for the first time in
                            their lives, and even taking personal risks by communicating openly with Israeli rabbis,
                            these students were able to use the coffee breaks to inspire the religious leaders with
                            their stories of personal transformation through dialogue with Jewish peers. Their intention
                            to write articles in the Indonesian and Farsi press in the coming days about the importance
                            of Muslim-Jewish dialogue is precisely the kind of action needed to ensure that what
                            happened in Seville does not remain in Seville.</p>
                        <p>At the end of the conference on Wednesday, the leaders issued a joint
                            statement denouncing the use of religion to justify violence and urging respect for
                            religious symbols &#8212; an apparent response to the recent protests against cartoons
                            depicting the Prophet Muhammad. We took a short break at one point and saw the segment on
                            Al-Jazeera about the Congress in our hotel rooms &ndash; an exciting development and a sharp
                            contrast to the near total absence of US media coverage. But most viewers at home were
                            probably looking at this Congress with the same scepticism that they viewed the Arab Summit
                            in Khartoum these past few days. We have all come to expect lofty words and little action
                            from the gatherings of our leaders. We confess that we largely shared this concern while in
                            Seville.</p>
                        <p>But let us be grounded in reality. The gulf between our two communities worldwide is
                            enormous. And this will not change overnight. The fact that such a gathering of prominent
                            religious personalities took place with the level of interpersonal comfort and mutual
                            commitment to dialogue that we witnessed, provides an essential boost of support for those
                            of us who do this work full-time.</p>
                        <p>Let us all do our part in the coming year to build bridges of dialogue, discovery and
                            respect.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the

                    and religious news, events,
