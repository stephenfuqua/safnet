                    <div class="lead">
                        <p>The Pew Research Center recently conducted an opinion poll in the United States looking at
                            public tolerance for religious groups and inter-religious cooperation. While they found that
                            both evangelical Christianity and Islam are not well accepted in the U.S. compared to other
                            groups, their analysis (presented below) shows that Catholics and Jews are seen much more
                            favorably than they once were, suggesting capacity for a continued dynamism in the American
                            public&#8217;s perception of religions.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p class="author">By Pew Research Center</p>
                    <div class="entry">
                        <p>Although tolerance is an American ideal and freedom of religion is enshrined in the First
                            Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, American history has often been characterized by
                            inter-religious conflict. Without question, however, much progress has been made in
                            overcoming blatant forms of institutionalized religious discrimination. But historic
                            tensions among American religious groups, not to mention heightened concerns in the
                            post-9/11 world about a clash of civilizations, ensure that the question of inter-religious
                            relations will remain an important issue for the public as well as for religious and
                            political leaders.
                        </p>
                        <p>Public opinion polls conducted by the Pew Research Center shed some light on inter-religious
                            relations and the prospects for inter-religious cooperation and understanding. The findings
                            confirm that certain historical religious divisions and tensions have largely been put
                            aside. Catholics and Jews, for example, once the objects of widespread and often
                            institutionalized discrimination, are now viewed favorably by a sizable majority of
                            Americans. But the poll findings also suggest that other religious groups, including
                            evangelical Christians and especially Muslims, are not fully accepted by many Americans.</p>
                        <p>American society and politics were once characterized by bitter religious divisions, often
                            pitting well-established, well-educated and well-off Protestants against newly arrived,
                            less-educated and less well-off Roman Catholics and Jews. Today, however, these divisions
                            seem to have been largely overcome. In recent polling, approximately three-in four Americans
                            express favorable opinions of Catholics and Jews. Even among white Protestants and seculars,
                            large majorities hold positive views of these groups.</p>
                        <p>Evangelical Protestants also are viewed favorably by a majority of the public, though
                            substantially fewer Americans express favorable views of evangelicals compared with Jews or
                            Catholics. Seculars, in particular, stand out for their wariness of evangelicals.</p>
                        <p>In short, this analysis suggests that the tensions that once existed between Protestants and
                            Catholics, and the hostility that Jews faced from both groups, have largely diminished.
                            Though evangelicals are viewed less positively than Catholics or Jews, all three groups are
                            viewed favorably by majorities of the public. These findings strongly suggest that the
                            United States has the capacity to overcome historical religious divisions and prejudices.

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
