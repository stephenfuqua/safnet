                            thanks Council on American Islamic Relations for support&quot;</p>
                        <p>I did not at first follow at all the kidnapping of a Christian Peacemakers
                            Team (CPT) in Iraq, nor the execution of journalist Tom Fox. My immediate,
                            unfounded assumption was that this was a missionary group who shouldn&#39;t
                            have gotten in the middle of an Islamic civil war. I couldn&#39;t have been
                            more wrong. Quoting from the Mission of the CPT, &quot;<em>Christian
                                Peacemaker Teams (CPT) offers an organized, nonviolent alternative to war and
                                other forms of lethal inter-group conflict. CPT provides organizational
                                support to persons committed to faith-based nonviolent alternatives in
                                situations where lethal conflict is an immediate reality or is supported by
                                public policy.</em>&quot; I am humbled by the devotion to religious principle
                            that lead these four into Iraq. Truly Mr. Fox&#39;s passing is a martyr&#39;s
                            death.</p>

                        <p>Events in Iraq and Afghanistan
                            brought a mixed reaction to Dr. Bob Edgar, general secretary of the National
                            Council of Churches USA.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;We lift up prayers of thanksgiving for the rescue of our Christian
                            brothers, Norman Kember, James Loney and Harmeet Sooden,&rdquo; Edgar said of
                            the three hostages from Christian Peacemaker Teams. &ldquo;We are also
                            thankful for the courageous men and women of Coalition and Iraqi forces who
                            accomplished this rescue without violence. Our joy is boundless and we greet
                            God&rsquo;s mercy with humility and awe,&rdquo; Edgar said in a
                            statement.</p>
                        <p>His joy was tempered by the mourning expressed earlier this month for CPT
                            member Tom Fox, a member of the Society of Friends (Quakers).</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;In the midst of this celebration, we continue to grieve for Tom
                            Fox, the fourth Christian Peacemaker captured by terrorists in Iraq. Tom was
                            brutally tortured and killed by his abductors, who undoubtedly singled him
                            out because he was an American. But Tom was no different than his three
                            friends &ndash; a devoted Christian who stood for peace and was an
                            understanding advocate of millions who felt the same bitterness as his
                            murderers,&rdquo; Edgar said.</p>
                        <p>Edgar also expressed gratitude for U.S. Muslim groups who spoke against
                            the hostage taking of the CPT members and are speaking out on the trial of an
                            Afghani convert to Christianity.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;We also express our deepest thanks to Council on American-Islamic
                            Relations (CAIR) and other Muslim groups who have called for Abdul
                            Rahman&rsquo;s release,&rdquo; Edgar said. &ldquo;In the post-9/11 world,
                            CAIR has never hesitated to speak words of conscience and compassion based on
                            their understanding of the Qur&#39;an. &lsquo;Truth stands out clear from
                            error,&rsquo; CAIR said recently, quoting Qur&#39;an 2:256. &lsquo;Therefore,
                            whoever rejects evil and believes in God has grasped the most trustworthy
                            hand-hold that never breaks,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said in his statement.</p>
                        <p>The Rev. Dr. Bob Edgar heads the oldest ecumenical Christian association
                            in the United States. It consists of 35 member churches from the Protestant,
                            Anglican and Orthodox traditions. Those communions represent 100,000
                            congregations with 45 million member.</p>

                            members</h2>
                        <p>We lift up prayers of thanksgiving for the rescue of our Christian
                            brothers, Norman Kember, James Loney and Harmeet Sooden. We are also thankful
                            for the courageous men and women of Coalition and Iraqi forces who

                        <p>Yet in the midst of this celebration, we continue to grieve for Tom Fox,
                            the fourth Christian Peacemaker captured by terrorists in Iraq. Tom was
                            brutally tortured and killed by his abductors, who undoubtedly singled him

                            murderers.</p>
                        <p>Our prayers also continue for the safety of other gentle and courageous
                            sisters and brothers who stand for peace and God&rsquo;s love around the
                            world. The Christian Peacemaker Teams in Iraq, Africa, Colombia and
                            Palestine, the World Council of Churches&rsquo; Ecumenical Accompaniment
                            Program in Palestine and Israel, and others routinely go to the world&rsquo;s
                            trouble spots to place themselves between looming danger and vulnerable
                            innocents. We thank God for those who risk their lives to remind the world
                            that the realm of God is peaceful and just. As Jesus said, greater love has
                            no one.</p>
                        <h2>Statement by Bob Edgar on Muslim support for endangered Christians</h2>
                        <p>The National Council of Churches USA stands with other persons of faith
                            and good will in calling upon the government of Afghanistan to release Abdul
                            Rahman, who faces the death penalty for converting from Islam to
                            Christianity.</p>
                        <p>We also express our deepest thanks to Council on American-Islamic
                            Relations (CAIR) and other Muslim groups who have called for Abdul
                            Rahman&rsquo;s release. In the post-9/11 world, CAIR has never hesitated to
                            speak words of conscience and compassion based on their understanding of the
                            Qur&#39;an. &ldquo;Truth stands out clear from error,&rdquo; CAIR said
                            recently, quoting Qur&#39;an 2:256. &ldquo;Therefore, whoever rejects evil
                            and believes in God has grasped the most trustworthy hand-hold that never
                            breaks.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>CAIR was among the first to call for the release of the Christian
                            Peacemaker Team members in Iraq, they were among the first to urge freedom
                            for captured journalist Jill Carroll and they have consistently spoken words
                            of healing to a world torn by sectarian divisions. Their partnership is a
                            model of interfaith understanding and dialogue. Their rejection of evil and
                            trust in God is a bond we shall forever share.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
