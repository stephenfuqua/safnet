                        <p>The threats of violence &ndash; the rage permeating elements of many Arab/Muslim societies
                            &ndash; today reached new heights, with several deaths in Afghanistan and Lebanon and
                            hate-filled attacks elsewhere. In my <a
                                href="/inn/archives/2006/02/07/february-editorial/">editorial for
                                February</a>, I wrote that I did not understand the shear depths of this rage. Several
                            friends have correctly reminded me that many societies are still dealing with hundreds of
                            years of Western-domination, colonialism, and economic imperialism. To this, add the
                            repression and manipulation by dictatorial regimes &ndash; and you have a milieu that,
                            without even having to resort to a specific belief system, results in the riots we have seen
                            today.</p>

                        <p> But that is not the full story. There are also millions who decry the violence, who stand up
                            for their faith and say &#8220;This is not what the Prophet would have wanted.&#8221; There
                            are those in the international community who have, while defending freedom of speech,
                            condemned in the strongest terms those who abuse it to the great detriment of the rest of
                            society. In the interest of further promoting a &#8220;dialogue of civilizations,&#8221; as

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
