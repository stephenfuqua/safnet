                        <p>Dear Readers, </p>
                        <p>If I were to see a cartoon, or God-forbid an actual photograph, of Baha&#8217;u'llah in the
                            media, I would be stunned and extraordinarily upset at a media outlet so disrespectful of
                            the Baha&#8217;i injunction against direct portrayals of its Founder. Thus I can well
                            understand Muslim fury over the now Europe-wide publishing of a cartoon depicting the
                            Prophet Muhammad as a terrorist. What I cannot understand is the sheer rage that elicits
                            kidnappings, flag burning, and threats of violence. Let there be no doubt that this was a
                            grievous disrespect of a billion or so Muslims&mdash;and yet it is, was, and shall
                            undoubtedly remain perfectly legal in any open society.</p>
                        <p>Add a fresh element to &quot;clash of civilizations:&quot; the cherished Western belief in
                            freedom of speech and press versus the cherished Islamic belief in the sanctity of the
                            Prophet. To the westerners: freedom can be a dangerous thing indeed when it flies in the
                            face of basic and universal human dignity. You do it no honor when you blithely insult one
                            sixth of humanity. To my Muslim friends and colleagues: do threats of violence against Danes
                            and Westerners do anything to carry forward justice and equilibrium in your home countries
                            or in the world?</p>
                        <p>Closer to home, a Christian seminary president in Minneapolis, USA recently said &quot;it
                            would probably be an overreaction to firebomb these men&#8217;s houses,&quot; referring to
                            film directors who cast an openly gay man in the role of a Christian (and heterosexual)
                            missionary (I live in St. Paul, the &quot;other half&quot; of the Twin Cities of Minnesota).
                            Again I ask&mdash;how does this implicit threat advance your religious agenda? By this I
                            mean the one proclaimed by Christ, the one in which loving your neighbor is the most
                            important law after the law of loving God? To all: can we not instead focus our energies on
                            bringing greater justice, on bringing greater love and reconciliation, to our societies?</p>
                        <p>With these thoughts in mind, the January / February 2006 issue of InterfaithNews.Net carries
                            four articles and editorials focusing on the prospects for peace in the Middle East and the
                            role of interfaith dialogue in getting there, as well as an inspirational letter from Mussie
                            Hailu; a &quot;faithful&quot; state of the union; and a report on interfaith watchdog
                            efforts in Africa.</p>
                        <p>Peace be with you,<br />

                            The InterfaithNews.Net service ran from 2002 through 2006, hosting articles on the

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
