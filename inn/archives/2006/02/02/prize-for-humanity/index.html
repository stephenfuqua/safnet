                        <p>Long Beach, CA &mdash; The Immortal Chaplains Foundation
                            announced it will present its 7 th Prize for Humanity on Sunday February 5th
                            2006 from 2-4pm aboard The Queen Mary, an historic ocean liner that also
                            served as a WWII troopship. The four Chaplains - Jewish, Catholic and
                            Protestant - gave up their life jackets to soldiers on the torpedoed
                            troopship Dorchester, and went down together, arm-in-arm in common prayer on
                            February 3, 1943. Their self-sacrifice and compassion for others, regardless
                            of faith or race, was memorialized on a 1948 U.S. postage stamp entitled
                            &quot;These Immortal Chaplains - Interfaith in Action&quot;. Their legacy is
                            the basis for The Immortal Chaplains Prize for Humanity, given to &quot;those
                            who risked all to protect others of a different faith or ethnic origin.&quot;
                            Honorees for 2006 are:</p>
                        <p><strong>Dr. Yehuda Stolov &amp;
                                <a href="http://www.interfaith-encounter.org/">Interfaith Encounter
                                    Association</a> in Israel &amp; Palestine;</strong>
                            Dr. Stolov, an Orthodox Jewish-Israeli, organized colleagues from Muslim,
                            Christian, Jewish and Druze faiths in 2001 to counter the escalating violence
                            between Israelis and Palestinians. Risking their lives, they held public
                            seminars to break down hostility and mistrust and have now created a
                            sustainable model of Interfaith understanding and hope. Representing the
                            organization&#39;s colleagues for the Prize will be Ms. Najeeba Sirhan,
                            Palestinian School Principal in Majd el-Krum.</p>
                        <p><strong>Petty Officer 2nd Class, Jonathan M. Rice &amp; U.S. Coast Guard
                                Rescue Teams;</strong> During the devastating 2005 &#39;Hurricane
                            Katrina&#39; in New Orleans, Coast Guard Petty Officer Rice and his crew of
                            rescue helicopter CG6522, were the first to appear to those abandoned to the
                            storm. As Rescue Swimmer, Rice risked all to affect the hoisting rescue of
                            223 persons &ndash; most of different ethnicity than himself. Meeting with
                            extreme physical hazards, Rice portrayed a positive attitude of hope
                            continuously for 5 days and nights.</p>
                        <p>Past Honorees include (2000) Paul Rusesabagina, subject of the recent
                            film, Hotel Rwanda; (1999) Amy Biehl, an American Fulbright scholar who died
                            in the struggle against apartheid in South Africa; and (2000) Chiune
                            Sugihara, a Japanese diplomat who signed over 5000 visas for Jews escaping
                            the Nazis in WWII. For a complete list see: www.ImmortalChaplains.org . The
                            Foundation recently move its headquarters from Minneapolis, MN to Long Beach,
                            CA aboard The Queen Mary. An Interfaith Memorial Sanctuary at the new
                            location will include a diorama depicting the final moments of the four
                            Immortal Chaplains and the 670 men who died with them.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
