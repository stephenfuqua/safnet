                    <div class="entry">

                        <p>NEW YORK &ndash; Interfaith leaders from the United States
                            and West Africa meeting this week in Liberia vowed to work together to
                            monitor government activity, work toward justice and equality, and minimize
                            corruption in West Africa to help achieve lasting peace in the region.</p>
                        <p>The action plan concluded a three-day international conference held in the
                            capital city of Monrovia, aimed at raising the visibility of peace efforts by
                            the religious community and consolidating those peace efforts in fragile,
                            post-conflict Liberia and other Mano River Union countries.</p>
                        <p>The gathering, keynoted by Liberia&#39;s new Vice President, Dr. Joseph N.
                            Boakai, was the first international conference held in Liberia since the
                            recent election of President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf. It also attracted
                            participants from the diplomatic community, civil society, and
                            non-governmental organizations.</p>
                        <p>&quot;It is time for creative strategies that will take us to the next
                            level,&quot; said the Rev. John McCullough, executive director of United
                            States-based global humanitarian agency Church World Service. Church World
                            Service and the United States Catholic Mission Association co-sponsored the
                            event.</p>
                        <p>African and supporting U.S. interfaith leaders agreed to a strategy of
                            organizing around country-specific action programs for Mano River Union
                            countries Liberia, Guinea-Conakry, and Sierra Leone and around overall
                            programs for the entire Mano River region.</p>
                        <p>Church World Service&#39;s McCullough said inter-religious councils in
                            each region will spearhead grassroots campaigns to reach out to communities
                            for the purpose of ensuring citizens a voice in peacebuilding efforts.</p>
                        <p>The councils also will work with national reconciliation groups attempting
                            to heal the wounds of wars that have ravaged the region. Regional faith
                            leaders committing to the initiative included Protestants, Catholics,
                            Muslims, and Baha&#39;is.</p>
                        <p>Set against the backdrop of renewed hope in a country that just this week
                            inaugurated a democratically elected president, Ellen Sirleaf-Johnson, after
                            decades of civil war, the conference challenged participants to work across
                            denominational lines and to confront pressing issues &quot;with
                            impunity.&quot;</p>
                        <p>McCullough said that in addition to addressing issues of good governance
                            and regional cooperation, the faith community must deal with &quot;the
                            lingering hurts and pains of a people who have suffered too long.&quot;</p>
                        <p>The sentiment was echoed by Boakai in his keynote address. The
                            vice-president pledged &quot;overwhelming support&quot; for peace
                            consolidation efforts but cautioned that those who feel &quot;left out of the
                            political process&quot; must see improvements in their lives if there is to
                            be a lasting peace.</p>
                        <p>The groups also agreed to focus on the roles of youth and women in
                            consolidating peace.</p>
                        <p>The conflict-ridden Mano River region is a focal point of NGO Church World
                            Service&rsquo;s current Africa Initiative. CWS and the Fellowship of
                            Christian Councils and Churches in West Africa (FECCIWA) will collaborate in
                            monitoring peace consolidation efforts in the overall West Africa region.</p>
                        <p>FECCIWA Secretary General Baffour Dokyi Amoa, who led a conference
                            discussion on the role inter-religious councils in Liberia, Sierra Leone and
                            Guinea play in peacekeeping and conflict management, expressed delight at the
                            prospect of councils following up with work in their respective
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>&quot;I was very excited that people from different organizations and
                            backgrounds could share ideas and recommendations and finally commit to
                            carrying out these concepts and specific actions at national levels,&quot; he
                            said.</p>
                        <p>The agreements come at a critical time for the region. Liberia has seated
                            its new president, the first woman ever elected to lead an African nation.
                            Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf replaces ex-president Charles Taylor, who was forced
                            into exile in Nigeria in 2003. More than 250,000 people were killed in
                            Liberia&#39;s civil war and thousands more were displaced. One month ago,
                            United Nations peacekeepers left neighboring Sierra Leone, pledging to help
                            the government and people recover from a brutal civil war that left at least
                            75,000 people dead and thousands more maimed.</p>
                        <p>&quot;The sense of unity and common purpose was inspiring,&quot; says the
                            Rev. William Dyer, executive director of the Washington, D.C.- based Africa
                            Faith and Justice Network. Reflecting on the interactions between people from
                            different countries and different faiths traditions, Dyer, a member of the
                            Roman Catholic missionary order Society of the Missionaries of Africa, adds
                            that &quot;the openness and acceptance of each other and the willingness to
                            walk together is very encouraging&quot; for the prospect of peace.</p>
                        <p>The timeliness of the faith community&#39;s coming together around efforts
                            to maintain a still-fragile peace in the region, was underscored in remarks
                            by European Union Representative Godfrey Rudd. One of several public
                            officials who attended the conference, Rudd urged closer adherence to
                            principles of the Bible and the Koran.</p>
                        <p>&quot;You cannot consolidate peace without talking about
                            reconciliation,&quot; said Moses Ole Sakuda, associate director of Church
                            World Service&#39;s Mission Relationships and Witness program. &quot;The fact
                            that all these people were in one room talking is an important step toward
                            reconciliation, which will lead to consolidation.&quot;</p>
                        <p>Determined to confront neglect and corruption by public official,
                            participants also agreed that the inter-religious council in each country
                            would hold a biennial forum for the faith community and civil community to
                            determine whether their legislative and judicial officials are acting in a
                            manner that promotes peace.</p>
                        <p>&quot;Civil societies and faith bodies aren&#39;t going to sit on the
                            fence,&quot; declared Amoa. &quot;They&#39;re going to take their roles and
                            civil responsibilities very seriously,&quot; by speaking out if they
                            determine that the government is not acting in the best interests of the
                            people.</p>
                        <p>A U.S. delegate, Susan Sanders, minister and team leader for global
                            sharing of resources for the United Church of Christ, came away convinced
                            that the global community of faith must actively support those efforts by
                            West Africa&#39;s faith community. &quot;We in the wider church must
                            accompany our sisters and brothers on this long walk and be advocates for the
                            continued engagement of the international community in rehabilitation and
                            restoration efforts,&quot; said Sanders.</p>
                        <p>The gathering represents the culmination of a process started in 2002 when
                            Church World Service accepted an invitation from ecumenical groups in the
                            Mano River Basin to come to West Africa to support them in peace building
                            efforts. In March 2003, Church World Service invited the Mano River Basin
                            religious leaders to the United States, where they met with policy makers at
                            the United Nations, the White House, the Department of State, and on Capitol
                            Hill, warning the U.S. and international bodies of impending crisis in
                            Liberia.</p>
                        <p>The interfaith delegation from the United States, led by McCullough and
                            Sister Rosanne Rustemeyer, a former executive director of the United States
                            Catholic Mission Association, included representatives of Protestant
                            denominations and Catholic missionary orders. The West African delegation
                            included Christian, Islamic, and Baha&#39;i representatives from Mano River
                            Union countries.</p>
                        <p>The conference was hosted by the Liberian Council of Churches and
                            co-sponsored by Church World Service and the U.S. Catholic Mission
                            Association under the banner of the Continuing Committee on Common Witness,
                            formed by the two groups as a forum for ecumenical dialogue on mission
                            issues. This is the first such event the committee has held outside the U.S.
                            and the first time it has included international ecumenical partners.</p>
                        <p>Other members of the U.S. delegation were Luke Asikoye, associate for
                            international disaster response, Presbyterian Church (USA); Rita Tams

                            The InterfaithNews.Net service ran from 2002 through 2006, hosting articles on the
                            former
                            interfaithnews.net website and distributing a periodical newsletter to a mailing list of

                            version
                            of the site has been restored in 2021 through careful extracts from the <a

                            reformating for consistency. No editorial changes have been made &mdash; all of

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
