                    <p class="author">By Mohammed Abu-Nimer</p>
                    <p class="postdate">February 1, 2006</p>
                    <div class="entry">
                        <p>WASHINGTON DC &#8212; For the last two decades scholars and practitioners of
                            peace have promoted the hypothesis that religions and religious actors can be
                            sources of peace and pluralism, and not only sources of war, violence and
                            conflict. Others are less sure of the benefits of including a religious
                            aspect in resolving conflicts. In Israel-Palestine, some even feel that the
                            inclusion of religious actors does more harm than good in attempting to
                            resolve the conflict.</p>
                        <p>It is usually incorrect to view any conflict as being caused or dominated
                            by one source or dimension. Thus, religion and religious identity in places
                            of conflict like Northern Ireland, the Philippines, India or Israel/Palestine
                            should be seen as one influential factor among several others, such as
                            economics or politics.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, in a context like the Israel-Palestine conflict, religion
                            has been manipulated by the three religious groups involved to fuel and
                            perpetuate past and current violence (religious symbols, rituals and sites
                            are constantly brought into the conflict dynamics). It is, therefore, crucial
                            to constructively engage people&#39;s religious identity as a source of peace
                            and pluralism to counter its manipulation in the cycle of political
                            violence.</p>
                        <p>Having completed a study that examined interfaith dialogue in five Middle
                            Eastern societies of Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Israel and Palestine, it became
                            clear that many civil societies and some of these governments understand the
                            potential constructive role that interreligious meetings can play in bridging
                            the gaps within each society.</p>
                        <p>However, there are few interfaith initiatives between Israelis and
                            Palestinians in the region. Some of the reasons that Palestinians gave for
                            demonstrating caution in participating in such meetings were the risk of
                            normalizing the occupation; frustration resulting from the failed Oslo peace
                            process; the fact that Jewish-Israeli organizations are the initiators of
                            these activities; and that most of these meetings avoid focusing on the
                            political reality of occupation and oppression.</p>
                        <p>A Christian priest declared in one of the study&#39;s interviews: &quot;I
                            have participated in interfaith dialogue for over 15 years, but after the
                            second intifada, I could not do it anymore. They kill our children during the
                            day and we dialogue with them at night. I found that impossible to
                            tolerate.&quot;</p>
                        <p>Despite the above critique and reasons for rejecting interfaith work, a
                            few interfaith initiatives do offer an exceptional opportunity for Muslims,
                            Christians and Jews to discuss their faiths in a peaceful setting. As a
                            result, they contribute to breaking down negative stereotypes; learning more
                            about other faith groups (their rituals, ceremonies and basic tenets); and,
                            most importantly, rehumanizing the &quot;enemy&quot;.</p>
                        <p>In a reality of hatred, suicide bombings and 40 years of occupation and
                            humiliation, images of the other side are dehumanized and the two people have
                            no space (social, public or even personal) to meet face to face. Under such
                            circumstances, interfaith dialogue becomes a rare window through which Arabs
                            and Jews view each other as humans and learn to cope with their mutual
                            ignorance of each other&#39;s faiths.</p>
                        <p>Among the successful initiatives is the well-cited January 2002 Alexandria
                            meeting, convened by the then-Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. George Carey, and
                            hosted by the Grand Imam of Al Azhar, Sheikh Mohammed Sayed Tantawi.</p>
                        <p>This resulted in the first ever declaration signed by leaders of all the
                            faiths in the Holy Land, including the Sephardi Chief Rabbi, Bakshi-Doron;
                            the Chief Justice of the Sharia Courts, Sheikh Taisir Tamimi; the Latin
                            Patriarch, His Beatitude Michel Sabbah; deputy foreign minister, Rabbi
                            Michael Melchior; and the Anglican Bishop of Jerusalem, the Rt. Reverend Riah
                            Abul Assal.</p>
                        <p>Their statement called for the Palestinian and Israeli governments to
                            implement a peace process and, as religious leaders, they pledged to continue
                            a joint quest for a just peace that would lead to reconciliation in Jerusalem
                            and the Holy Land, for the common good of all our peoples. They also
                            announced the establishment of a permanent joint committee to carry out the
                            recommendations of this declaration, and to engage with their respective
                            political leaderships accordingly.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, escalating violence reduced the impact of this important
                            declaration and its translation into immediate practical steps on the ground.
                            However, the recent inauguration of a Palestinian/Israeli Religious Leaders
                            Council and the establishment of interfaith centers in Jerusalem and Gaza can
                            be seen as offshoots of the Alexandria process.</p>
                        <p>Although interfaith dialogue is not going to resolve the conflict and end
                            the occupation, many Palestinian participants continue to attend such
                            dialogues in hopes of educating Israeli Jews about their national aspirations
                            and accurately presenting their Muslim and Christian faiths and their basic
                            tenets.</p>
                        <p>Similarly, Jews who attend these meetings, though they understand that
                            they are meeting with politically &quot;marginalized&quot; Palestinians,
                            discover that they are alike in their desire for peace and rejection of
                            violence.</p>
                        <p>&quot;We are the only space where women can talk about religion and
                            peace,&quot; declared an Israeli Jewish woman participating in one of the
                            very few interfaith women&#39;s groups in the Middle East. In this group,
                            Christian, Jewish and Muslim women gather on a regular basis to discuss their
                            views and explore their perceptions of their faiths and traditions.</p>
                        <p>Clearly these interfaith groups face many limitations and obstacles,
                            including lack of funding, little government support and the continuing
                            conflict. In addition, Israeli and Palestinian policymakers are not usually
                            involved with, or even updated on, these initiatives. Sometimes, long-term
                            planning is also missing.</p>
                        <p>Despite the above shortcomings, interfaith dialogue does have the
                            potential to play an important and necessary role in helping people and
                            politicians realize that they cannot resolve the conflict in the Holy Land
                            without genuine input and consideration from its religious communities.</p>
                        <p>Most importantly, interfaith dialogues provide an all too rare opportunity
                            for Christians, Jews and Muslims to work together as fellow human beings in
                            the joint pursuit of conquering their mutual ignorance and learning to live
                            together in peace.</p>

                        <p>We need to do more than dialogue. We need to sit down at table with each other as families,
                            and encourage our children to listen to each other, to share the food and the stories, and
                            the beauty of those common threads that bind us together as God&#8217;s holy and beloved
                            children. If God is indeed a God of love, then surely His children will demonstrate that
                            brightest and best of His qualities. As it says in Christian scripture &#8220;God is love,

                            The InterfaithNews.Net service ran from 2002 through 2006, hosting articles on the

                            version
                            of the site has been restored in 2021 through careful extracts from the <a

                            reformating for consistency. No editorial changes have been made &mdash; all of

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
