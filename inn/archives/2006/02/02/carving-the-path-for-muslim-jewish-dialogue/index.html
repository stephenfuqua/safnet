                        <p>The need for a continuing dialogue between Jews and Muslims is all too
                            apparent in the world&#39;s news. Professors Judea Pearl, father of slain
                            journalist Daniel Pearl, and Akbar Ahmed share some of the findings from
                            their three-nation tour of &quot;The Daniel Pearl Dialogue for Muslim-Jewish
                            Understanding,&quot; which show a path ahead for productive and meaningful

                    <p class="postdate">January 19, 2006</p>
                    <div class="entry">
                        <p>Washing DC / Los Angeles - Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&#39;s
                            recent declaration that Israel should be &quot;wiped off the
                            map&quot;&mdash;far from being an isolated case &mdash; underscores the
                            reality that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict must be viewed in the context
                            of global tension between Muslims and Jews, tension that is exacerbated by
                            hostilities in the region and that simultaneously helps fuel those
                            hostilities by inflaming fear and mistrust between the two sides.</p>
                        <p>Those fiery words, first delivered to thousands of students at a
                            &quot;World Without Zionism&quot; conference, were meant to rally support for
                            the Iranian regime by appealing to deeply entrenched sentiments in the Muslim
                            community, the great majority of which perceive the establishment of the
                            state of Israel as a conspiratorial injustice that is responsible for
                            numerous problems that plague Muslim countries.</p>
                        <p>This mounting tension calls for an urgent and powerful international
                            dialogue between Muslims and Jews to air basic grievances and search for
                            common ground and shared goals. We would like to share a few observations
                            from our dialogue program, &quot;The Daniel Pearl Dialogue for Muslim-Jewish
                            Understanding featuring Akbar Ahmed and Judea Pearl&quot;.
                            Over the past two and a half years we have been convening town-hall styled
                            dialogues between Muslims and Jews in eleven cities in the US, Canada and the
                            UK.</p>
                        <p>We initiated this program convinced that dialogue between Jews and Muslims
                            is a necessary step toward easing world tension. We set to ourselves two
                            organizing principles; first, no issue is taboo and, second, disagreements
                            should be represented as two narratives side by side. Issues ranged from
                            theological interpretations of Biblical and Koranic texts down to hot issues
                            in the news. Each of us learned to respect how the other perceives history
                            and, with the help of the mixed audiences, each has offered ways of
                            reconciling differences between the two perceptions.</p>
                        <p>We can identify a set of core priorities in our respective communities
                            that came out of the dialogues, which we present here as position statements
                            that Jews and Muslims want to convey to, or hear from, each other.</p>
                        <p>Firstly, Jews would like unambiguous statements condemning anti-Semitism
                            and other forms of religious intolerance. Muslim communities need to take a
                            clear moral stand regarding anti-Semitism, whatever their feelings about the
                            politics of the Middle East. Muslim leaders must ensure that the current
                            surge of anti-Semitism in Muslim countries is acknowledged, checked and
                            fought back at the highest levels of government.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Muslims would like to convey to Jews that the religious basis
                            for rejecting anti-Semitism is deeply rooted in Islamic civilization, as
                            affirmed by the many and strong bonds among the Abrahamic faiths of Judaism,
                            Christianity and Islam. These include the respect Muslims have for shared
                            biblical figures such as Abraham, Isaac and Moses, and for many rituals and
                            values.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Jews want to hear that Muslim education and media are prepared to
                            portray modern Jews, with their contemporary rituals and beliefs, as
                            legitimate heirs and equal carriers of the Abrahamic tradition. In other
                            words, in addition to revering Abraham and other Biblical figures, Muslim
                            educators must acknowledge that modern Judaism, with its many shades, is a
                            perfectly legitimate version of the teachings of those Biblical figures.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, Muslims would like to explain Islam&#39;s attitudes toward and
                            practice of democracy, human rights and civil liberties, to gain trust in
                            their ability to implement those rights and liberties in the context of
                            Islamic traditions. Here the example of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of
                            Pakistan revered by Pakistanis as the Quaid-i-Azam, or great leader, is
                            illuminating. Jinnah was the embodiment of parliamentary democracy and
                            believed in human rights and respect for the law. He achieved the creation of
                            Pakistan in1947, then the largest Muslim nation on earth, without ever
                            breaking the law.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, Jews must be given clear understanding where Muslims stand with
                            regard to the State of Israel. Reaction to Israel is complicated by the
                            strong feeling Muslims have for Palestinians, whom they see as oppressed.
                            Simultaneously, Muslims need to understand Jewish history and respect Jewish
                            national aspirations. A double narrative of the Israeli and Palestinian
                            peoples needs to be heard in both the Muslim and Jewish media. Framing the
                            Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a clash between two legitimate national
                            movements is a crucial step for constructive discussion of this issue.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, Muslims point out that there is a growing sense of Islamophobia
                            in the West that allows the prophet of Islam and the religion itself to be
                            attacked with impunity. This encourages the perception that the loss of
                            Muslim lives is of little concern to the rest of the world, and further feeds
                            into the sense of anger, desperation and injustice&mdash;which then
                            strengthens violent people. Unfortunately, many Muslims perceive the
                            Islamophobia as a creation of Jews, and there is a conspiracy-theory mindset
                            that tends to blame Jews for the ills of the Muslim world. Jewish leaders
                            must be more active and visible in the fight against Islamophobia. Muslim
                            leaders, in turn, must help dispel unfounded conspiracy theories.</p>
                        <p>Seventhly, on the issue of terrorism, Jews would like to hear Muslim
                            leaders take an unequivocal moral stance, against both the perpetrators of
                            terrorist acts and the ideologues and legitimisers of such acts - in
                            particular, suicide bombings against Israelis. The red line against the
                            targeting of innocent lives cannot be crossed for any grievance.</p>
                        <p>Finally, in order to overcome the chasm of misunderstanding and bad
                            history that exists between the two communities, an official long-term,
                            public dialogue of the Abrahamic faiths must be supported. Such on-going
                            dialogue needs a role model; we were inspired by the legacy of Daniel Pearl,
                            an American Jewish journalist who earned respect in Muslim society and who
                            came to symbolize the very ideals of religious tolerance and East-West
                            dialogue.</p>
                        <p>With the help of this symbol, we were able to carve a path of legitimacy
                            in our communities and to witness our dialogues playing a positive role in
                            the warming of relations between Israel and the Muslim world.</p>
                        <p>The lesson we draw from our experience is that individuals&mdash;Muslims
                            and Jews, youth and adults, public officials and religious
                            leaders&mdash;should not be discouraged by incendiary calls for the
                            destruction of Israel. Each of us, all of us, should advance our own human
                            interactions and diplomacy efforts to carve the path of dialogue. And it is a
                            dialogue not only of civilizations, but for the future of humankind.</p>

                        <p>A thoughtful article. One thing to consider- the attitude of Muslims to &#8216;dhimmi&#8217;
                            communities needs to be redefined in language that recognizes the legitimacy of other faith
                            communities. You mention the history of Muslim-Jewish tensions as if the two communities
                            were on a level playing field. History, and demographics clearly demonstrate that Jews have
                            always been a disadvantaged and oft persecuted minority regardless of where they have lived.
                            Vastly outnumbered by their powerful Muslim neighbours, is it too much to ask for a small
                            strip of arrid land to call home? Or are Jews and other non-Muslims so vile as to only
                            deserve humiliation and eventual annihilation? Is this Muslim diety a God of love and mercy
                            for all, or only for those who subscribe to specific doctrines? I greatly fear the future.

                            The InterfaithNews.Net service ran from 2002 through 2006, hosting articles on the
                            former
                            interfaithnews.net website and distributing a periodical newsletter to a mailing list of
                            a
                            few thousand. The original database was lost due to poor management of backups. This
                            version
                            of the site has been restored in 2021 through careful extracts from the <a
                                href="https://web.archive.org">Wayback Machine</a> with substantial stylistic
                            reformating for consistency. No editorial changes have been made &mdash; all of
                            the
                            recovered
                            text has been preserved.

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
