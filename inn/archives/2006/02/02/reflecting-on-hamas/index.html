                    <div class="entry">
                        <p><a id="more-101"></a>
                        <p>My Dear Friends, </p>
                        <p>Greetings of love and peace.</p>
                        <p>Like people all over the world, and especially our sisters and brothers in
                            the Middle East, I have followed the Palestinian election with intense
                            interest and great hope that the results would lead toward a secure, just and
                            prosperous peace for the Palestinian and Israeli people.</p>
                        <p>Both people have suffered far too long. Both people, if we believe the
                            results of public opinion polls over the past several years, yearn for peace
                            and are prepared to see their governments reach a peace accord.</p>
                        <p>So what do I make of the emerging results this election that would remove
                            the Fatah party from power and replace it with Hamas?</p>
                        <p>To be honest with you, I don&#39;t know.</p>
                        <p>I would like to continue hoping for the best. Hamas has won an obviously
                            strong following among the Palestinians. Some attribute this following to
                            Hamas&#39; success in providing social services for the people; others say it
                            is a reaction to Fatah&#39;s corruption and ineffectuality. Both of these
                            motivations to support Hamas seem positive.</p>
                        <p>And yet it is easy to be seized by despair. Hamas continues to avow the
                            destruction of Israel, not a starting point for peace. And there are concerns
                            that they may attempt to create a Palestinian society governed by an extreme,
                            conservative practice of Islam. Many in the international community,
                            including in the Israeli government, want nothing to do with Hamas.</p>
                        <p>The months that lie ahead will reveal much about both the near and long
                            term prospects for peace in the Middle East. I pray those prospects grow
                            better and better as the days and weeks pass.</p>
                        <p>I pray that Hamas will disavow its stated commitment to destroy Israel and
                            cease from all violence against innocent civilians.</p>
                        <p>I pray they will build on their successes providing a better life for the
                            Palestinian people, that they will eliminate corruption from the government
                            and commit to an open society where people are free to practice their
                            religion as they see fit.</p>
                        <p>I pray that Israel&#39;s leaders find a constructive way to engage the new
                            Palestinian government, a path that leads away from unilateralism and
                            violence, forging a true partnership to establish a just and sustainable
                            peace.</p>
                        <p>I pray that leaders and people of the other nations of the world will do
                            all in their power to help create the necessary conditions for such a
                            peace.</p>
                        <p>It is said that as Benjamin Franklin watched the often tumultuous
                            deliberations of the Constitutional Convention that would determine the
                            future of the United States, he was alternately filled with despair and hope.
                            He found himself looking at the chair sat in by George Washington, who
                            presided at the convention. On its back was a half-sun, either rising or
                            setting. During those deliberations, Franklin often wondered if the sun and
                            the convention were setting into the darkness of division, or rising on a new
                            day of a shared, positive destiny.</p>
                        <p>By the end of the convention, he determined that the sun was, indeed,
                            rising.</p>
                        <p>So, today, as we watch the events unfolding in the Middle East, it is easy
                            to wonder if the sun is setting into the darkness of deeper violence and
                            division, or rising on a new day where violence ceases, old enmities are
                            healed and the Israeli and Palestinian governments and people move forward
                            together in peace.</p>
                        <p>For my part, I will pray that the sun is rising.</p>
                        <p>Love,</p>
                        <p>Charles</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
