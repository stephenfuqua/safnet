                        <p>Dear Friends on the Pathway to Peace,</p>
                        <p>Greetings of peace and light. God&#39;s blessing as we begin this New
                            Year. May we be with his presence at deep levels of our thinking, feeling and
                            acting. There are so many inspiring stories and news to share with you.</p>
                        <p>One of the tremendous achievements of humanity in the 20th century is that
                            ordinary men and women like you and me are increasingly recognizing our
                            responsibility to help resolve issues of local, national and international
                            concern. It is with this in mind that we all join the United Religions
                            Initiative to promote enduring, daily interfaith cooperation, to end
                            religiously motivated violence and to create cultures of peace, justice and
                            healing for the Earth and all living beings.</p>
                        <p>As Gandhi so beautifully said, we should &ldquo;be the change we want to
                            see in the world.&rdquo; If we can change ourselves, we can change the world.
                            It everyone does his or her bit, together we can accomplish our common dream
                            which is a better and peaceful world in which all humankind can live in peace
                            and harmony along with nature and all other living beings.</p>
                        <p>Our world is continuously changing, and in this changing world we
                            can&#39;t remain as we are, nor can we go back to conditions that are now
                            behind us. We can only move forward, but not on the same path which has been
                            leading us into war, conflict, violence, hunger, discrimination, poverty,
                            disrespect, hate and all the other negative elements. We should not go on
                            living in crisis and conflict. The world need not remain violent, and
                            economically, socially and ecologically unsustainable. We can progress
                            towards harmony, cooperation, livable communities, and a value system that
                            nourishes and sustains us and all things that live on this Earth. For this to
                            happen we need to follow the Pathway to Peace&mdash;a path which lead as from war
                            to peace, from killing each other to co-existence, from disrespect to
                            honoring each other, from hate to love, from despair to hope, from darkness
                            to light, from being selfish to living for the sake of others and from
                            revenge to forgiveness. For me, URI is this Pathway to Peace. We need to be
                            guided by the Golden Rule and Spiritual values. Values like</p>
                        <p>A love of Truth&mdash;Essential for a just, inclusive and progressive
                            society. A sense of Justice&mdash;Recognition of the rights and needs of all.
                            A spirit of Cooperation&mdash;Based on the principle of right human
                            relationships. A sense of personal Responsibility&mdash;for family,
                            community, country, the world and nature. Serving the common
                            Good&mdash;through the sacrifice of selfishness. What is good for all is good
                            for each one.</p>
                        <p>Some of the problems our world is suffering, especially in developing
                            countries, are war, unemployment, widening income gaps, environmental
                            degradation, HIV/AIDS, poverty, climate change, lack of basic needs. Though
                            the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 25.1 says &quot;Everyone
                            has the right to a standard of living which is adequate for the health and
                            well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing
                            and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in
                            the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other
                            lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control,&quot; the reality is
                            far from this. Though we have started the journey, we have a long way to
                            go.</p>
                        <p>By acting wisely, effectively and collectively through URI, and by
                            engaging others, we can create a more peaceful and better world for all. It
                            is already happening. Recent research on world conflict has demonstrated that
                            there are fewer armed conflicts now than in 1992. With so many problems in
                            the world, we often lose track of what is positive and so we are not aware
                            that the work we are doing is making a difference.</p>
                        <p>I want to take this opportunity to thank all of you for your dedication to
                            the work of URI. One of the most important aspects of choosing to work within
                            an association like URI is the fact that it is an opportunity to work in a
                            group, rather than as an individual alone. A group like ours represents true
                            unity-in-diversity&mdash;a unity focused by a common vision and the
                            principles through which that vision is realized.</p>
                        <p>Our work is most powerful when we work as a team. As you know, there are
                            cooperation circles throughout the world who are working tirelessly to make
                            this world a better place for all. This is something we can collectively
                            celebrate.</p>
                        <p>Thank you for being with URI on this Pathway to Peace. Together we can
                            make it.</p>
                        <p>May Peace Prevail in our Mind<br />
                            May Peace Prevail in our Heart<br />
                            May Peace Prevail in our Family<br />
                            May Peace Prevail in our Country<br />
                            May Peace Prevail on Earth</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
