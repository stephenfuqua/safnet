                <h2>Archbishop of Canterbury Delivers Major Inter Faith Lecture</h2>
                <p class="author">By Anglican Communion News Service</p>
                <p><a href="mailto:acnslist@anglicancommunion.org">acnslist@anglicancommunion.org</a><br />[<em>via <a
                            href="http://www.wfn.org">Worldwide FaithNews</a></em>]<br /><em>Date</em> Thu, 12 Jun
                    2003 00:34:20 +0100</p>
                <p class="noindent">Dr Rowan Williams has today (Wednesday 11 June)delivered his first major address on
                    inter faith relations since becoming Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>
                <p>Speaking at the University of Birmingham, Dr Williams challenged some basic assumptions about
                    relations between faith communities religions and secular society.</p>
                <p>Dr Williams warned policy makers against treating religion as a separate and subordinate sphere of
                    life. He also challenged religious traditions to be clearer about the true nature and extent of
                    their differences.</p>
                <p>Dr Williams criticised the secular tendency to view religion as "a subdivision of human activity
                    which
                    belongs among the optional extras, after you have attended to the clear imperatives of non-religious
                    public life."</p>
                <p>He also spoke of misconceptions that could arise when faith communities were harnessed for government
                    and other programmes.</p>
                <p>He said, "Sometimes there can be an expectation that religious communities will simply follow a
                    broadly liberal social agenda, and a consequent anger and disappointment when this
                    doesn't materialise... What matters is to recognise that the religious group starts from a
                    perspective which on some questions will deliver conclusions similar to those of the secular
                    progressive and on some questions definitely will not."</p>
                <p>Turning to religious traditions themselves, Dr Williams called fora clearer appreciation and
                    understanding of "the very significant disagreements about the kind of universe we inhabit, what
                    that universe makes possible for human beings and what is the most truthful or adequate or even sane
                    way of behaving in the universe."</p>
                <p>He added, "Once we are clearer about the nature and scope of religious disagreement, we are actually
                    more rather than less develop a respectful and collaborative practice in
                    inter-faith relations." Faith schools, he added, could play an important role in that process.</p>
                <p>Dr. Williams went on to criticise the religious intolerance of some faith-based states. They betrayed,
                    he said, "a very disturbing lack of confidence in their own religious resourcefulness."</p>
                <p>He praised non-theocratic societies for allowing real contention about religious truth. But the
                    secular vision of society also had to strive to make itself credible: "When it refuses this," he
                    said," we have a mirror image of theocracy - an uncriticised ideology defining the terms of public
                    life."</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
