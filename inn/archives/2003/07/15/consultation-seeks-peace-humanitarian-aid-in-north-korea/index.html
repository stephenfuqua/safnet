                            WASHINGTON (UMNS) &mdash; Participants in a consultation on the Korean crisis
                            have called for immediate negotiations to find a peaceful solution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Religious leaders from South Korea and the United States joined with
                            humanitarian workers June 16-18 to seek immediate, international
                            conversation focusing on a nonviolent resolution of the crisis with North
                            Korea &mdash; a crisis fueled both by that country&#39;s pursuit of nuclear weapons
                            and by the need of its people for humanitarian aid.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &#8220;A clear statement from the White House that North Korea will not be
                            attacked will establish a political climate for progress in
                            negotiations,&#8221; the group said in the consultation&#39;s message.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hosted by the National Council of Churches of Christ in the USA and
                            Church World Service, a U.S.-based international relief organization
                            related to more than 30 denominations, the event included participation
                            of the Korean National Council of Churches. But the North Korean
                            delegation was prevented from attending when the SARS crisis halted
                            flights to Asian capitals, where the North Koreans had planned to obtain
                            visas to visit the United States.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &#8220;We have been concerned that (U.S.) foreign policy has moved from
                            diplomacy to pre-emptive strikes,&#8221; said the Rev. Bob Edgar, NCC president
                            and a United Methodist, at the conclusion of the consultation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The people of faith have a vital role to play in concluding a
                            non-aggression pact and speeding humanitarian aid to the people,
                            he asserted, echoing the consultation&#39;s statement.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &#8220;The military solution is no solution at all!&#8221; declared the Rev. Syngman
                            Rhee, a former NCC president and past head of the Presbyterian Church
                            USA. He said this was the collective opinion of the consultation.
                        </p>
                        <p> Rhee emphasized the consultation was a significant event in 20 years of
                            cooperation on peace and unification issues between the National Council
                            of Churches of Christ USA and the Korean National Council of Churches.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Rev. Jong-Hwa Park, an officer of the National Council of Churches in
                            Korea, said that South Koreans have been living in an inter-Korean peace
                            that was fragile but much better than an atmosphere of confrontation and
                            hostility. The Koreans&#39; peaceful co-existence is being threatened by the
                            nuclear crisis of North Korea and the pre-emptive attack policy of the
                            United States, he said.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            His people desire a nuclear-free Korea, he said. He expressed the hope
                            that a three-way negotiation among North and South Korea and the United
                            States could achieve this goal. The people of both countries do not want
                            a repeat of the Korean War, which devastated the peninsula between 1950
                            and 1953, he attested.
                        </p>
                        <p> The Rev. Victor Hsu, a senior adviser with Church World Service and
                            organizer of the consultation, described the &#8220;ongoing humanitarian
                            crisis&#8221; in North Korea he had seen on a trip there in April.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &#8220;I can testify to the deteriorating health (and) malnutrition among the
                            North Korean people,&#8221; Hsu said.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He noted that Church World Service was among the first to respond in
                            1995, at the beginning of the current Korean crisis. During this period,
                            the organization with the help of the churches has provided &#x0024;4.3 million
                            in assistance. With each shipment, a CWS delegation went to North Korea
                            to see the distribution of the relief supplies, he noted.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &#8220;The contribution of Church World Service has helped reverse the trend in
                            stunted growth and in wasting among children,&#8221; Hsu said, referring to a
                            nutrition report issued by UNICEF and the World Food Programme in March.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With his input and that from other participants, and citing reports from
                            United Nations officials, the consultation strongly encouraged the
                            international community and churches to provide health and agricultural
                            assistance to the people of North Korea, and particularly asked the U.S.
                            government to be generous in its aid.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Edgar said the consultation was part of an NCC emphasis on peacemaking
                            that began last year and initially dealt with trying to avert a war in
                            Iraq.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &#8220;What we&#39;ve discovered over the last nine months is that there are two
                            superpowers: One is the United States and the other is world opinion,&#8221; he
                            said. &#8220;Government needs to do its role, but the people of faith need to
                            stand up and do their role&#8221; &mdash; to cut across boundaries and work for peace
                            and reconciliation.

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
