                <h2>Interfaith Leaders Call For Tough Stand Against Religious Extremists</h2>
                <p class="author">By Stephen Kaufman, Washington File Staff Writer</p>
                <p class="postdate">19 June 2003</p>
                <p>Washington&mdash;Moderate Muslim, Jewish and Christian
                    representatives called upon their co-religionists and the adherents of all three Abrahamic faiths
                    to stand up to religious extremism and to educate each other, the media and government officials
                    about how those faiths promote teachings of peaceful coexistence.</p>
                <p>The representatives, a
                    panel of clergy and laypeople from the Islamic, Jewish, Protestant and Catholic communities, met on
                    June 13 at the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee's (ADC) annual conference in Crystal
                    City, Virginia, to discuss the role of religious faith in the aftermath of the September 2001
                    terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, the 2003 conflict in Iraq, and the ongoing crisis
                    between Israelis and Palestinians.</p>
                <p>Imam Yahya Hendi, from the Georgetown University Islamic
                    Center, decried religious extremism that is used to justify violence, saying, "Sadly, in the name
                    of peace, peace is murdered."</p>
                <p>He argued that it was very important for believers to confront
                    the extremists in their midst and tell them "no more in my name."</p>
                <p>"My challenge to my
                    colleagues on the panel here, my challenge to each and every one of you: Are you willing to say 'no
                    more in my name?'" asked Hendi. "Muslims must not allow Osama bin Laden and like minded people to
                    speak on behalf of Islam because they don't, and they must not be allowed to do so. Jews must not
                    allow the State of Israel to become the representative of the Torah, the Tanach, ...
                    and Christians must not allow this war in Iraq to become a war in the name of Christ as some may
                    see it," he said.</p>
                <p>Hendi said that justice "should be the goal of every one of us." If he
                    felt he had to stand up to a fellow Muslim and tell him that his interpretation of faith or
                    faith-based action was wrong, "I have to do it," he said.</p>
                <p>Cherie Brown, co-founder of the
                    Jewish Alliance For Justice and Peace, echoed the imam's challenge, saying it "is
                    absolutely essential that we put our voices out, that we need to say what the religions that we
                    love and cherish truly teach ... [and] we need to be willing to have the courage to take on our own
                    communities and to look for what we believe to be the genuine crystals of faith of
                    our communities."</p>
                <p>Each representative voiced frustration over the fact that often the most
                    extreme voices are presented in the mass media as representatives of their respective faiths,
                    seeking to give religious justification for such things as suicide bombings by Muslims,
                    Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, and conservative Christian support for Israeli
                    hard-line policies.</p>
                <p>Reverend Stan Deboe, Justice and Peace Director for the
                    Catholic Conference of Major Superiors of Men's Institutes, said that during the recent military
                    conflict in Iraq, moderate religious voices, such as the National Council of Churches, were
                    speaking out against military action, and were virtually silenced by the media.</p>
                <p>"They were
                    there, but the media wouldn't publish it, and in fact when the media would do something, they would
                    say that American church leaders are out of step with the people in their pew and they should shut
                    up," said DeBoe.</p>
                <p>He accused the Bush administration of listening to the views of more
                    extremist Christians, while marginalizing and neglecting faith communities that spoke out against
                    the war and ignoring their repeated requests to meet personally with the president.</p>
                <p>But
                    alongside their frustration with government officials and the media, the panelists strongly urged
                    their co-religionists to empathize with each other through their own faith traditions and to learn
                    how to see different faiths through the eyes of those who practice them.</p>
                <p>Imam Hendi said
                    teachers and educators "can change the world more than tanks can." He said he wanted to learn about
                    Judaism, "not as portrayed or spoken about or preached by Muslims, but as spoken in synagogues,"
                    and called upon Christians and Jews to learn "not the Islam of Fox News, CNN, NBC, or CBS, but the
                    Islam that is preached in the Holy Qur'an."</p>
                <p>This understanding of Islam, said Hendi,
                    "teaches me that when a bomb goes off in a synagogue in Tunisia, I consider that a bomb is going
                    off in a mosque in Mecca. And when a man carries a bomb and bombs a church in Islamabad, he is
                    bombing, for me, the Kaaba," and he called upon others to feel the same empathy when Muslims
                    are targeted.</p>
                <p>At the same time, he said his answer to extremist Christian leaders who had
                    publicly denounced the Islamic faith is, "you continue to hate, we will continue to love. You
                    continue to throw stones upon us; we will continue to throw roses upon you. That is my faith and
                    that is what it teaches me to do."</p>
                <p>Cherie Brown, who described herself as a Jewish peace
                    activist, founded her organization, the Jewish Alliance For Justice and Peace, specifically to
                    fight racism and prejudice. Reminiscing about her early years, she related that she confronted a
                    rabbi at her religious school who told her class that Arabs were the enemies of the Jewish people.
                </p>
                <p>"I was sent home with a note that my parents should teach me to not talk back to the rabbi,"
                    she said. "I don't think I learned that lesson because I've been talking back ever since!"</p>
                <p>
                    She advised activists to organize events where victims of discrimination can speak out about their
                    experiences and bring home the message of how destructive racism and hatred can be.</p>
                <p>"You
                    change people's minds, you change their hearts," she said, "and what changes hearts is when they
                    can hear a personal story, particularly when that story is emotional."</p>
                <p>Brown said many U.S.
                    Jews were outraged by media, criminal and legal assaults against Arabs since the September 11,
                    2001, terrorist attacks, and wanted to find ways not only to stand in solidarity, but also to
                    confront the anti-Palestinian rhetoric emanating from parts of the Jewish community, which she said
                    is a "violation of our faith and our Judaism."</p>
                <p>Brown said her organization was inviting
                    Muslims who had experienced discrimination to speak publicly on college campuses. "When hundreds
                    of students and faculty administrators hear those stories, it opens up something that all of the
                    learning and reading can't open up," said Brown.</p>
                <p>Reverend DeBoe said that, for his part,
                    the September 11 attacks had created "a new world of understanding" for him, as he suddenly felt
                    vulnerable and could empathize with others such as refugees and the homeless. He said that people
                    were now living in "the world of September 12," in which barriers of misunderstanding had been
                    removed and replaced by "new solidarity that all of us could experience."</p>
                <p>"I believe that
                    peace really involves crossing the divide of September 11 to step into the world of September 12,
                    to take the risk of creating a world that is different, ... to be able to look and say, they're
                    not against us, they're with us. And they're not just with us, we're here together."</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
