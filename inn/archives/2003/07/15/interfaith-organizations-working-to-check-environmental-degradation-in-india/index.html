                <h1>Interfaith Organizations Working to Check Environmental
                    Degradation in India</h1>
                <p class="author">By Mohinder Singh</p>
                <p class="postdate">June 25, 2003</p>
                <p>Dear Friends in the U.R.I.,</p>
                <p>As a part of promoting U.R.I's
                    preambles, principles and purposes some the U.R.I. Cooperation Circles have taken up the
                    initiative in checking growing environmental degradation by popularizing the tree plantation.</p>
                <p>A new initiative in this drive was taken by the Jathedar of Takhat Kesgarh Sahib, during the
                    tercentenary of the creation of the Khalsa in 1999 by offering saplings as Prasad to the devotees.
                    Since then most of the religious places have started the practice of developing nurseries in their
                    compounds and distributing saplings as Prasad.</p>
                <p>As part of our tree plantation drive the
                    Salwan School, one of the Cooperation Circles in India, has taken up the environment program in a
                    big way by organising a national conference on environment for All India Students on the 19th and
                    20th of April 2003 as a part of Golden Jubilee celebration of their school. They have also taken up
                    other projects like water and waste management and creating more awareness through involving
                    school children and their parents.</p>
                <p>The Patiala Cooperation Circle has come up with an
                    innovative idea of carrying on improvements in the cremation ground. They found the area where the
                    young children are cremated/buried was in a rather bad shape. As a part of their 72 hours in kind
                    contribution Mr.Ashwani Kumar and his friends of Patiala CC through voluntary labour improved the
                    cremation ground on the main Patiala-Rajpura Highway. They have beautified the place where children
                    are cremated/buried and have appropriately named it as U.R.I. Angels Park. They are going
                    to dedicate this to little angels who are cremated/buried there during ceremony.</p>
                <p>Some of
                    the Cooperation Circles in Delhi are joining in tree plantation drive during this rainy season.
                    Beginning will be made by planting trees in Gurdwara Rakab Ganj, near Parliament House, New Delhi,
                    on Sunday, 6th of July, 2003 at 8.30 A.M. in collaboration with the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management
                    Committee, Khalsa Environment Project and the Tibet House. This coincides with the 68th birthday
                    of H.H. the Dalai Lama.</p>
                <p>I write this to invite the CCs. from Delhi and other parts
                    of India if they could join us in the tree plantation drive on Sunday, 6th July, 2003 at 8.30 A.M.
                    in Gurdwara Rakab Ganj, New Delhi. s</p>
                <p>We will make arrangements for stay of outstation guests
                    on prior intimation. Do please join us in this drive.</p>
                <p>With best wishes,<br /> Sincerely,
                </p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
