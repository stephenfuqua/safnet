                    <h3>
                        December 18 - 26 Kerala, South India
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        I had met Abraham Karickam at the URI Asia and the Pacific Regional
                        Conference in Bali in 2001. Since then, Abraham was instrumental in
                        helping to organize his own CC, the Cosmic Community Center and in
                        fostering the development other CCs in Kerala. Several years before,
                        Abraham had heard Bishop William Swing speak about the United Religions
                        Initiative when the Bishop addressed a large conference of the Mar Thoma
                        Church. Bishop Swing&#39;s description of the URI&#39;s vision inspired and matched
                        Abraham&#39;s vision. Abraham continues to keep this vision alive locally.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Abraham has served as a professor of Comparative Literature at the Mar
                        Thoma College in Thiruvalla for 22 years. In addition to his teaching
                        work, he is a lay leader in the Mar Thoma Church and has published 15
                        books. Abraham is also a community leader in his home of Kottarakkara and
                        Karickam, smaller more rural communities south of Thiruvalla.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Abraham had planned a full agenda for us. I was privileged to receive one
                        of the best learning experiences of my life through his efforts. (I was
                        pleased to learn that Kerala is the home of Arundhati Roy, author of the
                        best seller, The God of Small Things.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the first day here, we met several faculty and students at the Mar
                        Thoma College and I was asked to offer greetings at the faculty Christmas
                        luncheon. Later, Abraham and I spoke with the very delightful and
                        spiritually alive leader of the entire Mar Thoma Church, the Metropolitan
                        Chrysostom. The three of us spoke for about an hour and shared ideas
                        about many subjects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Kottarakkara and Karickam, Abraham generously opened his community to
                        my visit and we met many family and friends. In recent years, Abraham has
                        worked with people locally to establish a successful YMCA network that
                        serves people in need of shelter and offers other community services.
                        Abraham has also developed his own interfaith group, the Cosmic Community
                        Center and offers peace training programs and various other offerings.
                        One great success is that the Cosmic Community Center is able to raise
                        money each year to send one or two young adults for an extended visit
                        with the Taiz&eacute; community in France. Abraham has close ties with
                        the Taiz&eacute; community and he hopes one day to create a residential
                        interfaith community that is inspired by the spirit and guidance from
                        Taiz&eacute;. Taiz&eacute; was founded early in the 20th century as a
                        Christian community and residence in France and this community is now
                        effectively linked with as worldwide network. Taiz&eacute; focuses on
                        personal spiritual growth, renewal, meditation, chanting, and reflection
                        in light of Christian teachings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On December 21 the Cosmic Community Center and the Mar Thoma Dialogue
                        Center co-sponsored a large gathering, An Interfaith Christmas Program. A
                        male choir from the Salvation Army opened the festivities. Over 100
                        people were in attendance and were very interested to be updated by
                        Abraham about recent local interfaith activities and to hear about the
                        URI. To finish my
                        presentation, I decided to introduce an appreciative interview question
                        and requested that people form pairs and ask each other the question,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Imagine it is 2012, eight years from now and there are good changes in
                        Kerala. The religions have worked together and now people are enjoying
                        the benefits of several years of cooperation and leadership among people
                        of different faith traditions. What is happening? What is different? What
                        important changes have taken place?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I realized that people might be shy to try this kind of interaction
                        because it was a new procedure for them. However, almost all of the
                        people jumped into conversations and a delightful hum rose in the hall.
                        After the interviews, several people came to the microphone to share the
                        highlights. One young man stirred the crowd by proclaiming that he was
                        filled with hope and the promise of a better life here and he went on to
                        describe in detail the positive changes he saw possible. In listening to
                        these impromptu declarations of hope and possibility, I was again moved
                        by the power of appreciative interviews to release the ideas and passions
                        and commitments of so many people. I was happy that I chose to take the
                        risk and offer a break from speech-giving.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next day, we attended a friend&#39;s wedding at the local Seventh Day
                        Adventist Chapel. The Chapel is connected to the school which was founded
                        by American missionaries and it was the school Abraham attended as a boy.
                        It sits on a ridge with a beautiful view of rice fields and coconut palm
                        woodlands. Abraham pointed out that we could see his boyhood home from
                        here and as a boy all he had to do was run across the rice paddy and up
                        the hill to get to school. Several hundred people attended the wedding
                        and all were invited to the community center in Karickam for a sit down
                        meal afterwards (which had to take place in two shifts because of the
                        crowd!). The community center and nearby store are managed by Abraham&#39;s
                        good friend and one of the vice presidents of the Cosmic Community
                        Center, Benny Malachi.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another evening we met Dr. K.C. Mathews, the head of a remarkable social
                        service center, The International Center for Study and Development, which
                        is applying to be- come a CC with the URI. This Center has a strong
                        track record of working with challenging local problems such as elderly
                        care, child labor, aids intervention, and medical needs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Abraham is well-connected and in one afternoon we visited his friends:
                        Mar Thoma clergy leaders, a Muslim scholar&#39;s family, clergy from the
                        Orthodox Serbian Church, and family relatives and friends that seem to
                        appear everywhere. One evening we visited the home of a Hindu man, a
                        Dalit (the untouchable caste), who is a good friend of Abraham&#39;s and
                        another vice president of the Cosmic Community Center. His name is
                        Nytyananadan means "forever happy". Many Dalits convert to Christianity
                        here. (This family was preparing to drive 18 hours east this night to
                        participate in a wedding. The bride, his niece, is marrying a member of
                        the 7th Day Adventist Church and they will live in the Tamil Nadu region
                        of India and do missionary work) Religious affiliation changes a person&#39;s
                        identity socially and politically in India. As a Christian, a Dalit would
                        no longer be considered officially in the Dalit or untouchable, caste.
                        However, when Dalits become Christian, they are no longer eligible for
                        any government support that is made available to Dalits. It is a Catch
                        22.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On another afternoon, at a gathering of CC members at Abraham&#39;s home, Mr. M.C.
                        Varghese from the Vayakkal CC, shared that in his area the
                        CC has bogged down because
                        some Hindu members believe that URI is an American operated
                        organization that is really trying to convert people. I remind him that
                        the principles in the Charter state clearly what the URI is and that there are several
                        highly regarded Hindu leaders in India who are involved in the
                        URI who might be
                        able to help him. We agree that it is a good idea to translate the
                        Charter into Malayalam, the language spoken here. I see how important it
                        is that CC leaders have
                        regular contact with each other and work together to try and meet the
                        needs and share successes. Even if no clear answers are forthcoming, it
                        is imperative for CC
                        members to exchange support and feel connected with one another.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Several young adults are involved in the Cosmic Community Center
                        CC. A few have been trained
                        by Abraham in peacebuilding techniques that Abraham learned from
                        participating in a course at Eastern Mennonite University some years ago.
                        One boy commented that this exposure to peacebuilding training here in
                        Karickam was "the best experience of his life!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In August 2004, the Cosmic Community Center will host its first
                        International Inter-faith Conference on Inter-textuality of the Holy
                        Books. They plan to draw about 50 scholars from around the world to their
                        Dialogue Center at Kottarakkara. Participants will present papers and
                        host discussions about scriptural passages from the holy books of the
                        major faith traditions. The conference will also showcase Abraham&#39;s
                        recent book, Concepts of Salvation from the Upanishads, the Kur&#39;an, and
                        the Bible. Dame Meher Master Moos has already reserved a place at the
                        conference!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We were invited to attend a Christmas Eve service at a nearby Mar Thoma
                        Church. The rector and his wife were wonderful leaders and they were
                        excited to have me and Abraham as honored guests for their service.
                        Abraham gave a stirring Christmas sermon that included an explanation
                        about interfaith work and I offered my impressions of Kerala in a
                        Christmas greeting to the people. I loved the service that included: a
                        teen age choir and drummers singing indigenous songs, candelabra on
                        either side of the sanctuary with rainbow colored candles, a wan little
                        Christmas tree with a few lights and balloons, overhead fans whirring,
                        graceful chandeliers glowing, and a full church of men and women and
                        children with eager faces. I noted that even though many children
                        performed skits and songs, there were no flash bulbs or video cameras
                        present. People here do not have an abundance of things. Sitting up front
                        facing this full church of expectant, innocent and bright-eyed smiling
                        people who looked as if there was no other place in the world that they
                        would rather be, made it feel like a very holy night indeed for me.

                        The following day, the Karickam family (Susan, Abraham&#39;s wife, Ann Mary,
                        18 year old daughter and Aby, 21 year old son) and I headed further south
                        to Trivandrum, the capital of Kerala and then still further south to the
                        southernmost tip of India, Cape Cormrant. At Cape Cormrant we gazed out
                        to the horizon where the Bay of Bengal, the Indian Ocean and the Arabian
                        Sea mingle together. We visited the famed monument to Swami Vivekananda
                        and we saw a recently constructed monument to the famous Tamil poet,
                        Thirvalluvar.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At Vivekananda&#39;s monument, we found a special room for meditation. We
                        read there that it was on this very day, Dec. 25, 1892 when Swami
                        Vivekananda came to this spot and meditated. Knowing our interfaith
                        history, we realized that a few months later, Vivekananda would make his
                        historic first visit to Chicago and inaugurate interfaith possibilities
                        in the world by attending the first Parliament of World Religions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next day, we returned to Trivandrum and the Karickam family delivered
                        me to the airport for the journey home to California.

                        A young barrister from Delhi, a seatmate on one of my train rides, had
                        commented that when I arrived in Kerala that I should be prepared to
                        enjoy the "sweet nectar of human innocence" in the people there. He was
                        right.

                    <h3>
                        Reflection
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The challenges in India at this time are staggering. There are over one
                        billion people in India and it is estimated that 17 million people are
                        born each year (the entire population of Australia). There are 24 states
                        in India. There are 17 official languages and 200 actually spoken
                        languages in India. While democracy as an ideal is cherished, most people
                        consider most of the politicians to be corrupt. Air pollution in the
                        cities is high, traffic and population density can be overwhelming, water
                        is getting scarce. In Chennai (Madras) water is only available for two
                        hours in the morning and in the evening. Millions of people live below
                        the poverty line. The caste system and caste consciousness is changing
                        very slowly. Women remain under-educated and the dowry system remains in
                        force. Rights and opportunities for women are far from equitable. Many
                        talented young adults leave south India to work in the United Arab
                        Emirates because cities like Dubai and Bahrain offer much better
                        employment. Access to study and work in the US by citizens of India has
                        been severely curtailed by new immigration/visitation regulations in the
                        USA since September 11.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Religious affiliation offers a significant identity and placement in
                        society here. Families still arrange marriages about 98% of the time.
                        India&#39;s history of religious diversity is a primary gift of India. For
                        thousands of years, people of several major faith traditions have lived
                        and practiced their different religions side by side. However, the
                        history in India also points to the use of religions as a source of
                        religious conflict and violence. In the present global climate, the
                        prospect of inter-religious conflict and violence is very likely . The
                        stakes are high in India for interfaith interventions of various kinds to
                        make a positive difference to reduce and stop violence as well as to
                        mobilize people across religions to tackle common social and
                        environmental problems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For a westerner from a First World country, living conditions are
                        challenging. The shops sell what is needed for survival. Few "extras" are
                        available.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And, given this mountain of challenges, the people impressed me deeply.
                        They are talented, generous, strong, dedicated and willing to create a
                        better world for themselves and for India. Unprecedented levels of
                        cooperation between India (and other Third World countries) and the USA
                        (and other First World countries) must be a major part of the answer that
                        will set right the imbalance between those who have an overload of what
                        is needed for life and those who have such scarcity. I pray that
                        cooperation and relationships of trust and support blossom and multiply
                        among the people of the URI in India and around the
                        world. I pray and hope that URI&#39;s growing global community
                        proves to be a relentless beam of light especially in India. I pray that
                        Abraham&#39;s vision of creating an interfaith residential community in
                        Kerala modeled after the spiritual integrity of Taiz&eacute; becomes a
                        reality in the years ahead.

            <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                has sprung from the
                grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                and religious news, events,
                and resources.</p>
