                        <p>Andre Porto, URI Regional Coordinator for South America, reports on a new partnership called
                            &#8220;People Making Peace&#8221;, which has recently received a small development grant
                            from United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).</p>

                        <p><a id="more-47"></a>
                        <p>
                            I am happy to share with you that UNESCO has approved a small grant for
                            the project People Making Peace which is a result of partnerships between
                            URI, Viva Rio, Palas Athena Association, UNIPAZ, Afroreggae, American
                            University&#39;s Peace Institute and UNESCO (all took part during the Global
                            Assembly 2002). A meaningful fact is that the approval from UNESCO took
                            place at the same day the War on Iraq has atarted.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The project, PEOPLE MAKING PEACE was created in order to enable
                            individuals to peacefully resolve conflicts and build peace in their
                            communities. The project&#39;s partner institutions have put together a
                            multimedia kit of methodologies, tools and projects developed to
                            facilitate the practice of a culture of peace. Teachers, volunteers,
                            religious and community leaders, young people, police officers and others
                            will be trained using the various instruments offered in the Peace Kit
                            and on the website. Everyone will be invited to participate in the
                            Peacemakers Network which will promote the exchange of experiences
                            through both gatherings and the Internet.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Unesco is supporting the project&#39;s initial phase. It is a seed money (R&#x0024;
                            50.000 = US&#x0024; 15.000) that will enable us to do the creation workshop,
                            produce the prototype and train teachers of two UNESCO programs in Rio
                            within public schools and youth prisons. In fact, this way we will have
                            the opportunity to have a pilot stage and check out the impact of the
                            project.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We are sure that with the prototype in hands it will be much easier to
                            fundraise for accomplishing the rest of the project! It is also great
                            that UNESCO itself is sponsoring the project. They really loved it and
                            want to see it spreading worldwide. Two Brazilian minitries, Education
                            and Justice, are also looking forward to send one represantative each to
                            the workshop in order to follow up and get closer with our initiative.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thanks for your attention,

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
