                        <p>In the context of current global turmoil, the Rt. Rev. William E. Swing briefly explores a
                            few of what he sees as the &#8220;myths&#8221; of the peacemaking process.</p>

                        <p>
                            In religious circles there are at least two meanings to the word &#8220;myth.&#8221;
                            A myth is (1) a noble story which points toward the truth about history
                            rather than declaring what is historically true (Creation myths in the
                            Book of Genesis) and (2) a compelling story with a false premise that has
                            the potential of doing cataclysmic damage (Hitler&#39;s master race myth).
                            When leaders of our nation declare that we are not at war with Islam, I
                            can&#39;t help wondering which definition of myth I am hearing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I look at my Iraqi sisters and brothers of Islam, and I wonder about:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                <b>The myth of precision:</b> For two straight wars we have been
                                assured that our smart bombs would land only on the bad Muslims and not
                                the good ones.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>The myth of time:</b> We have been told that we would be in and out.
                                Yet by the end of the 1991 hostilities, we left between 300 and 800
                                tons of depleted uranium in that part of the world. Its half-life is
                                4.5 billion years. Radioactivity forever on Muslims.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>The myth of coalition:</b> Coalition sounds like a pulling together.
                                In reality it appears to be rending asunder the hard-won United Nations
                                global alliance, dismantling our European partnerships, and stirring up
                                animosity between a Christian/Jewish coalition and a global Muslim
                                coalition.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>The myth of democracy:</b> A former Islamic fundamentalist leader
                                who has made a radical transformation toward tolerance writes, &#8220;I am
                                frightened from the breakdown of democracy, transparency, international
                                law. Is this the end of the democratic free world? They kill our women
                                and children and talk about freedom, peace, and democracy.&#8221;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>The myth of our rightness:</b> I tremble when I read of the myth
                                circulated at the core of our leadership. That we are uniquely endowed
                                by Providence to save the world from evil forces if only we would take
                                the risks of leadership. Because of our moral superiority we must not
                                be limited by petty agreements such as mutual nuclear restraint,
                                landmines, or global emissions. Whatever happened to the understanding
                                that &#8220;we have all sinned and come short of the glory of God?&#8221; What
                                about checks and balances? About all people being equal? Muslims, too.

                            Religions are the custodians of many of the great myths. And these myths
                            have power, good and bad, to change life. If a myth encourages
                            religiously motivated violence, it deserves to be hauled out and
                            examined. In Indonesia the head of the most moderate, tolerant Islamic
                            organization says that this &#8220;war in Iraq is a sort of jihad, its own sort
                            of fundamentalism.&#8221; There&#39;s an aroma, a smell in the air of myth and
                            murder, righteousness and reward, fear and faith. I worry not that
                            religion is dabbling in politics. On the contrary, I am scared that
                            politicians are working from their homemade myths to create a national
                            patriotic religion. Bad for Muslims. Ultimately bad for the rest of us.

                        <p>
                            For the sake of Muslims, Jews, Christians and the whole Earth, we had
                            better embark on a massive, urgent search for the myths of peacemaking in
                            our religious traditions. Not the myths that foster cataclysmic damage
                            but the myths that tell the truth of history that is deeply embedded in
                            the primitive stories of faith. We are on the road to war with Islam if
                            our guiding myths say so. We are on the road to peace with Islam if our
                            guiding myths say so. The myth behind the policy is what ultimately
                            matters.

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
