                        <p>On Tuesday March 18, 2003, Joel Beverluis passed out of this world after several months of
                            struggling with cancer. He was a wonderful man who shall be dearly missed by his friends
                            from around the world. We all wish his family the best and thank them for supporting his
                            tireless efforts at promoting interfaith dialogue over the past ten years and more.</p>
                    </div>

                            1.
                        </h3>
                        <p>Dear Celia and other members of Joel&#39;s family, I met Joel many times at interfaith
                            gatherings over the past years and I was always impressed by his commit tent
                            to the field of interfaith work and to children. Joel did so much to help promote
                            interfaith concepts and to bring the many interfaith groups and organizations
                            together. I will always think of him as one of the quiet light bearers of the
                            interfaith movement whose life and dedication to interfaith harmony has been
                            a truly beautiful example to us all. </p>

                        </h3>
                        <p> He was such a beautiful man, with great soaring breadth of spirit. He as generous
                            to me personally and I was very grateful for his willingness to offer his forthright
                            support of an interfaith campaign I direct. As a former journalist, I also respected
                            him highly as the most careful and diligent chronicler of our contemporary interfaith
                            movement, as well as being one of our best historians, along with Marcus Braybrooke.
                            The interfaith movement is very much richer from his having devoted so much
                            of his life to nurturing its spirit, to helping it grow and to faithfully recording
                            so many of its words. </p>

                            3. Remembering a Giant Among Us
                        </h3>
                        <p>Joel Beversluis was schlepping books across a large patio outside conference
                            rooms at the UC Berkeley Student Union in 1994, the day I met him. The last
                            time we hugged good-bye was late at night outside the conference center of a
                            small Catholic college in Wichita last August - he was moving boxes of interfaith
                            books back into his car for the drive home to Michigan. </p>
                        <p>In nine years we&#39;ve only spent three or four months together, always at interfaith
                            gatherings, a long weekend with North American Interfaith Network colleagues
                            or a whole week in South Africa at the Parliament of the World&#39;s Religions or
                            summer summits at Stanford in the formational years of United Religions Initiative.
                            We talked at airports and in hotels, and once Jan and I were happy to share
                            our living room couch and conversation into the wee hours when a conference
                            brought him to San Francisco. </p>
                        <p>Good times together, but for such a few short years. I didn&#39;t know Joel well
                            enough to write a eulogy of his life. But when he died last Tuesday, I lost
                            a treasured colleague and friend. And the global grassroots interfaith movement
                            said farewell to a giant among us, a quiet pioneer whose work as a scout helped
                            direct and empower an interfaith movement developing into dozens of different
                            expressions all over the world. In the narrow confines of our gatherings, I
                            knew Joel well enough to know what a stunning loss his death is to the movement
                            he loved so well. </p>
                        <p>Joel left a 20-year career at Eerdmans Publishing, a large, well-respected
                            Christian press, to found CoNexus, an interfaith publishing house that was grassroots,
                            both in its interests and its daily struggle to generate an adequate income
                            for the family while generating a resource center serving people in villages
                            and megalopolises everywhere who are hungry for good interfaith tools. No doubt
                            the CoNexus impetus came from accepting an invitation from the Council for the
                            Parliament of the World&#39;s Religions as they planned a huge centennial celebration
                            of the Chicago 1893 Parliament. He was asked to compile and edit a resource
                            document for those attending the 100-year anniversary of the first public interfaith
                            dialogue in this nation. </p>
                        <p>Like its predecessor, the 1993 Parliament turned out to be significant historically,
                            and Joel&#39;s document became Sourcebook of the World&#39;s Religions (Third edition,
                            2000, <a href="http://www.conexuspress.com/">CoNexuspress.com</a>). It is the
                            one book an interfaith activist cannot do without, scanning the depth and breadth
                            of an emerging global movement bent on transforming interreligious interaction
                            from violence to mutual respect and cooperation.</p>
                        <p>Besides building CoNexus Multifaith Media into the largest distributorship
                            of interfaith resources in this country, besides taking those resources to one
                            gathering after another and another, he became a participating leader, joining
                            the board of directors of North American Interfaith Network (NAIN). For several
                            years he&#39;s written and edited the NAINews &#x0026; Interfaith Digest, making it
                            the best ongoing record of grassroots activities published in English, to my
                            knowledge. His hat as journalist was well earned as he recorded the first stories,
                            bits of news, and reports of neighborhood strangers from different faiths deciding
                            to get to know each other, here and abroad. Last year he and Stephen Fuqua,
                            a URI affiliate in Texas, launched InterfaithNews.net, an e-journal that promised
                            to start a virtual conversation about this work among practitioners, educators,
                            and interreligious activists around the globe.</p>
                        <p>Gandhi&#39;s suggestion that interfaith relations require humility was exemplified
                            in Joel Beversluis. He didn&#39;t talk about the work he did for the Parliament
                            and for Harvard&#39;s Pluralism Project, simply doing it with gentle good humor,
                            a complete commitment, and a twinkle in his eye. His Midwestern evangelically
                            rooted Christian faith embraced peoples of all faiths and spiritualities, and
                            he cared profoundly about getting the word out to everyone about the possibility
                            of healthy, constructive relationships with the other. </p>
                        <p>In the Sourcebook, Joel wrote, &#8220;The quest for a global ethic and other
                            forms of collaboration are now historically possible because of the emergence
                            of what some of us are naming &#39;the community of religions.&#39; This term describes
                            the shift across religious consciousness that encourages partnership and responsibility
                            for the common good.&#8221; Full of love and service, Joel Beversluis gave us
                            the first roadmap for that nascent community. We can each honor that extraordinary
                            heritage by living into the possibilities it promises. </p>

            <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                has sprung from the
                grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                and religious news, events,
