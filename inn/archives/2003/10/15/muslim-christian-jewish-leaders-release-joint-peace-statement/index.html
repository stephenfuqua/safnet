                            said, and urged Americans not to forget &#8220;the continuing suffering of the
                            Iraqi people, which demands large-scale international humanitarian

                            <b>AN URGENT CALL FOR REFLECTION, HOPE AND ACTION<br />
                                Interfaith Summit<br />
                                Chicago, Illinois<br />
                                April 30, 2003</b>
                        </p>
                        <p class="noindent">
                            As people of faith and leaders of diverse religious communities, we
                            recognize that we are at a moment of choice even more urgent than before
                            the war in Iraq began. We are faced with choices between hope and courage
                            or fear and violence; between a future characterized by global
                            solidarity, international cooperation and multilateral action or one
                            characterized by unilateralism and wars by choice rather than necessity;
                            continuing terrorism; unfettered efforts to extend U.S. power, and the
                            exploitation of fear.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Let us not forget who we are as people of faith. We need to go deeper
                            into our religious traditions. Fear is part of the human condition and is
                            only addressed through faith. We are challenged now to trust in God and
                            recognize the source of true security. Our traditions teach us to
                            envision a world of peace with justice. They promise God&#39;s capacity to
                            transform a broken world and God&#39;s expectation that we are partners in
                            the process.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As many Americans celebrate a moment of military victory, we, as people
                            of faith, ask all people to make this a time of deliberate reflection.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As we have since 9/11 and the beginning of the war on terrorism: we call
                            for greater understanding; we seek to dispel ignorance; we ask that this
                            be a time of humility not arrogance; and, we hope that all can be mindful
                            of what we have lost. We are mindful that while a repressive regime has
                            been destroyed, a country has been left in a power vacuum. We know as
                            well that those people experience their daily life as one of enormous
                            needs and insecurity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            War is a blunt instrument, which provides no lasting solution but too
                            often leads to further violence. We ask the American people to reflect
                            now on the price of unilateralism:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The cost of war and militarism
                            </li>
                            <li>The human toll of the war in Iraq
                            </li>
                            <li>The erosion of civil liberties in the United States
                            </li>
                            <li>The shift of resources away from human need to military purposes
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            In order to reflect most effectively on the choices that we face we call
                            on interfaith leaders in every American community to gather in town
                            meetings, teach-ins and other forms of community reflection to explore
                            what kind of society we seek to become.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Drawing on all of our traditions that are rooted in justice, compassion
                            and peace, we say to the present leadership of the United States:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>draw back from the use and threat of first strike war
                            </li>
                            <li>draw back from unilateral U.S. control over the reconstruction of
                                Iraq
                            </li>
                            <li>bring the U.S. occupation of Iraq to a prompt end by transferring to
                                the United Nations and multilateral, non-governmental organizations the
                                authority to work with the Iraqi people toward its own reconstruction
                            </li>
                            <li>make available U.S. resources as part of a world effort to serve the
                                needs and decisions of the Iraqi people.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p> Finally, we call on our fellow religious leaders throughout the world to
                            join in convening an INTERNATIONAL INTERFAITH SUMMIT that will provide a
                            worldwide forum for religious leaders to meet and discuss in depth ways
                            to eliminate the rhetoric of hate and to end violence perpetrated in the
                            name of religion. Together we must work to find ways to embody the power
                            of love, compassion and justice in this fragile and interdependent world.
                            We live in HOPE!

                            We are thankful for the end of large-scale hostilities, the end of an
                            oppressive regime, and the safe return of our troops.
                        </p>

                            We acknowledge the many sacrifices, and mourn all the loss of life.

                        <p>
                            We call for a national day of prayer and reflection, with a special
                            emphasis on interfaith gatherings.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We further call on the President to distance himself from religious
                            leaders who demonize the faiths of others.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We are compelled to call people&#39;s attention to the continuing suffering
                            of the Iraqi people, which demands large-scale international humanitarian
                            relief.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our religious traditions require that when we exercise power we reflect
                            deeply on the consequences of our actions and the true source of peace
                            and security. In this spirit, we encourage local religious communities to
                            organize interfaith days of fasting, prayer, and dialogue, which will
                            raise, among other vital concerns, those addressed in the accompanying,
                            &#8220;Urgent Call For Reflection, Hope and Action,&#8221; and to commit themselves
                            to donations for humanitarian relief for the people of Iraq.

                            The InterfaithNews.Net service ran from 2002 through 2006, hosting articles on the

                            version
                            of the site has been restored in 2021 through careful extracts from the <a

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
