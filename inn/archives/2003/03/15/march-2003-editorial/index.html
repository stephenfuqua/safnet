                            InterfaithNews.net began basic operations in the late summer of 2002,
                            with Joel Beversluis of CoNexus Multifaith Media as its primary editor.
                            Its purpose was and is to provide a window into the world of religious
                            and interfaith activity aimed at securing a better world through the
                            triumph of unity over division, of love over hate. Joel was diagnosed
                            with cancer in autumn, temporarily halting the nascent network. This
                            wonderful man passed out of this world in mid-March, and in his memory
                            and in recognition of his tremendous service to the interfaith community,
                            and by extension the whole planet, the remaining editor is all the more
                            determined to see this dream become a meaningful reality.

                            Exact guidelines and parameters for content do not exist at this time.
                            Discussions with funders and partners have identified many possibilities.
                            The world does not wait for perfect conditions, but perhaps this is the
                            perfect time to breath life back into this initiative. We&#39;ll work out the
                            details as we go.

                            In the midst of war and the diplomatic struggles leading up to it, social
                            activists from all across the spectrum have continued their vital work to
                            make the world a better place to live in. Perhaps said war will add to
                            their efforts; perhaps not. This writer cannot say. The latest site news
                            brings reports and stories from the Brazil, Germany, Israel, Pakistan,
                            and the United States, as well as articles on the current activities of
                            the U.R.I and Parliament of the World&#39;s Religions. Finally, we turn to
                            the Global AIDS Interfaith Alliance, or GAIA, in what we hope will be the
                            first of a regular series highlighting different interfaith
                            organizations.

                            The InterfaithNews.Net service ran from 2002 through 2006, hosting articles on the

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
