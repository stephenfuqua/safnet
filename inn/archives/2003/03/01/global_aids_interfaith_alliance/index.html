        <p class="author">By Global AIDS Interfaith Alliance</p>

		<div class="entry">
		<p>March 1, 2003</p><b>Culture of silence</b>
<p> When you work in Africa you become aware that the culture of silence surrounding
  HIV is nourished by the stigmatization of people living with HIV. A surprising
  news item recently described a moment of unprecedented candor:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A Malawi cabinet minister stunned his staff on Monday by openly announcing
    that he had lost three children to AIDS and condemning the taboos and stigmas
    surrounding the disease. Lands Minister Thengo Maloya was reported by the
    country's two dailies to have made the revelations at an HIV/AIDS seminar
    in the administrative capital of Lilongwe. Maloya, 56, said that his two sons
    and a daughter were in their 20s when they died from AIDS. ?This is
    a serious issue. It means me. It means you,? Maloya said while condemning
    the secrecy surrounding the disease. <br/>
    <em>(Agence France Presse, February 18, 2003)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p> A great deal of our work at the grassroots level addresses HIV/AIDS stigma
  through the education of clergy, educators, and local people. By training the
  religious infrastructures on which the population depends we help people de-mystify
  HIV and understand its basic biological characteristics. We support and encourage
  leaders in addressing the HIV/AIDS issue frankly, openly, and with compassion.
  We believe this to be an important step away from stigma, denial, silence, and
  judgmental attitudes.</p>
 <b>One village at a time</b>
<p> A highly effective way to support local Malawi communities is to provide assistance
  to village level projects. Congregations, organizations, and individuals are
  helping us support the villages by providing grants for these through GAIA.
  Since our last report of these partnerships in January the following new ones
  have been forged: Christ Church in Los Altos California is supporting the Tiyamike
  School in Ntiya for AIDS orphans with a grant of $1000. St. Luke?s Church of
  Darien Connecticut is providing $2000 to the Churches Action for Relief and
  Development (CARD) HIV prevention and orphan care program in Blantyre. The Institute
  for Family Development International has given a total of $5000, partnering
  with Chancellor College, Zomba, to provide full tuition and housing for a village
  woman to complete her studies, with TAKAO, in Blantyre, to buy and install an
  industrial oven to train women as bakers, and with the Lifeline Clinic in Ngodzi
  to construct a maize mill. Other partnerships are forming, and we are delighted.</p>
 <b>A message from Central Africa</b>
<p> Recently this word came from an infant care home with which a California parish
  is finalizing a partnership. We rejoice that they will soon receive much-needed
  help: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Malawi has been in the grip of a serious food shortage for some time. This
    is expected to carry into next year. It is now very much more difficult to
    return our two year olds to their communities as grand parents are finding
    it difficult to feed themselves let alone hungry infants. There appears to
    be no end in sight to the AIDS scourge in Malawi, each of the last five of
    our kids tested positive....</p>
  <p> most of our orphanages are full to bursting. This leaves us no alternative
    but to build a new unit to house up to 12 kids 2 years old and up until maybe
    5 years. We are reluctant to go down this road, as we have always seen ourselves
    as a transition home but this choice is being made for us. <br/>
    <em> (From Neville Bevis at Open Arms Infant Care Home, Blantyre, Malawi)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p> GAIA remains very grateful for the wonderful support of so many people in
  our country. With the generous support of our donors we have been able to make
  a difference. For further information, please contact William Rankin, GAIA President,

                            The InterfaithNews.Net service ran from 2002 through 2006, hosting articles on the

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
