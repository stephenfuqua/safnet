                        <p> JOHANNESBURG (AANA) October 6 - South African Deputy President, Jacob
                            Zuma, has appealed to African religious communities to help governments
                            in the quest for permanent peace.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He was speaking at the official opening of the Southern African
                            Inter-Faith Conference last Tuesday (September 30).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The conference, which drew more than 60 delegates representing seven
                            major religions from 11 southern African countries, is the first regional
                            follow-up meeting to last year&#39;s Inter-Faith Peace Summit in Africa,
                            jointly organised by the Geneva-based Lutheran World Federation (LWF) and
                            other faith-based organisations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Zuma emphasised that governments could not be expected to work alone
                            towards establishing peace and stability. &#8220;This is a multi-sectoral task,
                            requiring every stakeholder within African society&#8221;.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The religious community, he said, has an even bigger role to play, given
                            the fact that they reach millions of people each week.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &#8220;You are in a position to spread the message of peace and harmony. Give
                            the victims of violence hope and guide belligerents to realise that it is
                            possible to stop war and begin to reconstruct their own lives and their
                            countries,&#8221; said the deputy president.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He made a special appeal to religious leaders to assist in reaching out
                            to the leader of Burundi&#39;s Party for the Liberation of the Hutu
                            People-National Liberation Force (Palipehutu-FNL), Agathon Rwasa, whose
                            party has not joined the cease-fire process.
                        </p>
                        <p> Zuma, facilitator for the talks between Burundi&#39;s transitional government
                            and Palipehutu-FNL, noted that the days of war in Africa were over.
                            &#8220;People are learning that they can solve all problems through dialogue,&#8221;
                            he pointed out.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He further appealed to delegates to try and stop political leaders and
                            warlords from recruiting children into armed groups.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &#8220;You should use your moral and religious influence to stop the pressuring
                            of children to take up arms,&#8221; charged Zuma.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Earlier, LWF General Secretary, Rev Dr Ishmael Noko, who chaired the
                            conference, also urged faith groups to seek ways of forging relationships
                            with their respective governments to resolve conflicts, make peace and
                            contribute to nation building.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He told religious leaders to move away from merely gathering and reacting
                            in the context of specific events, and become pro-active through
                            sustained dialogue.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &#8220;Our practical inter-faith co-operation, which at present is intermittent
                            and dictated mostly by external events, could be so much deepened and
                            enhanced through dialogue,&#8221; he stressed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But, he cautioned, religious leaders should refrain from supporting party
                            politics. &#8220;There has been a strong tradition of siding with political
                            parties during liberation struggles,&#8221; he said.
                        </p>
                        <p> &#8220;But today, for a religious leader to align himself or herself and their
                            institution with one political party among many, compromises one&#39;s
                            possible role as a mediator in a conflict situation,&#8221; he continued.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Noko called for the establishment of an official instrument or structure
                            through which contact could be maintained between religious communities
                            and national governments in the Southern African region.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He underscored the need to have more young people taking leadership in
                            inter-faith relations and in &#8220;efforts to bring about peaceful change in
                            our societies&#8221;.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Change, he noted, would only &#8220;take place through idealism and enthusiasm,
                            and idealists are usually young people who are prepared to take risks and
                            push beyond boundaries&#8221;.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &#8220;The idealism and enthusiasm of young people can provide energy and
                            quality to the process,&#8221; he added.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He urged the conference participants to recognise the important role of
                            media in advocating inter-faith dialogue and giving public witness of
                            successful examples of inter-faith co-operation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But he also cautioned against &#8220;making peace for the sake of publicity&#8221;.
                            The best peacemakers, he stressed, &#8220;have a passion for anonymity&#8221;.
                        </p>
                        <p> He expressed hope that the regional conference would ensure that
                            communication would be a core element in the plan of action envisaged
                            from the gathering.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Participants in the September 30-October 1 conference at Kempton Park
                            Conference Centre included religious leaders from African Traditional
                            Religions, Baha&#39;i, Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jewish and Muslim faiths.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The theme of the conference was Promoting Peace and Harmony. It focused
                            on the implementation of the visions of last year&#39;s Johannesburg
                            Inter-Faith Declaration - Embracing the Gift of Peace.
                        </p>
                        <p> Southern African countries that attended the conference include Angola,
                            Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland,
                            Zambia, Zimbabwe and South Africa. There are also representatives from

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
