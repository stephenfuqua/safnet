                    <div class="entry">
                        <p class="noindent">What&#39;s about to unfold in Iraq may be the most dramatic
                            act yet in the tragic split we&#39;ve created in our minds between the natural
                            and supernatural; the physical and metaphysical. It may hasten their reconciliation,
                            or potentially begin the endgame.</p>
                        <p>Most of the world&#39;s people still live in an enchanted universe. They
                            see mindful intention causing every act in nature. Behind every motion is a
                            god or goddess or demon or angel or jinni or spirit who wills it as part of
                            an over-reaching plan.</p>
                        <p>But we in the developed world now live in a dis-enchanted universe, and have
                            for 400 years. We see every action as the result of mechanical, measurable processes:
                            thunder and lightning are not caused by an angry Zeus or Jove, but result from
                            an electrostatic discharge in the atmosphere. The unfolding of the cosmos is
                            simply a succession of statistical probabilities occurring over time.</p>
                        <p>And now the best engineering firms are bidding for contracts to rebuild Iraq.
                            They employ the best engineers who were taught at the best engineering schools
                            that, except for meeting or exceeding technical specifications, there is no intrinsic
                            value, meaning or grace in nature. </p>
                        <p>The people in the land they rebuild, however, still believe deeply that an
                            all-compassionate, all-merciful intention is behind the bending of every blade
                            of grass and the beating of every bird&#39;s wing.</p>
                        <p>This is not simply a cultural difference. Two universes are about to collide
                            as never before. From the land between the rivers, where Western Civilization
                            itself was born, will either come a new harmonizing of the
                            enchanted and disenchanted. Or it will be a replay of the tragic story of Babel,
                            when all civil discord and missed-communication was born as mortals tried to
                            engineer a path to God with selfish intentions. This time, however, the play
                            will be enacted on a global stage with weapons and passions of unprecedented
                            ferocity.</p>
                        <p>The pursuit of truth is humanity&#39;s noblest undertaking. Claiming to possess
                            the one truth is humanity&#39;s greatest failure. Let us pray for noble actions
                            and noble outcomes on all sides, and so rekindle a sense of awe and reverence
                            for a measurable, but no less grace-filled, world.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
