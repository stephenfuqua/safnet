                        </p>
                        <p>PRINCETON, NJ - More than a decade has passed since the end of the Cold War,
                            and the world has abruptly entered a new era in which religious belief can
                            seem distressingly linked to acts of terrible violence.</p>
                        <p> Assorted terrorists, sometimes acting as mobs, sometimes working alone as
                            suicide bombers, often cite religious beliefs to try to justify murder and
                            mayhem.</p>
                        <p>On one hand, this means that religion must be regarded with the utmost
                            seriousness in the 21st century, for the world cannot be fully understood
                            otherwise. But should these events also impel believers of different faiths
                            to work together for understanding and harmony?</p>
                        <p> An answer might be found in the words of the eminent Swiss theologian Hans
                            Kung, who once wrote that peace among nations will be impossible without
                            peace among religions. And there could be no peace among religions without
                            dialogue, he said.</p>
                        <p>That&#39;s a tall order. It demands that members of different faith
                            groups speak with one another as equals, discussing their religious beliefs,
                            discovering common ethical ground, while also recognizing their theological
                            differences.</p>
                        <p> The problem is that doing this involves overcoming centuries of suspicion
                            and
                            mistrust that often divide faith groups. In addition, the differences between
                            major religions are momentous, distinguished by claims to absolute truth that
                            cannot be ignored.</p>
                        <p>Against these odds, however, a trend toward interfaith dialogue has emerged,
                            gaining steam in the late twentieth century, especially in the United States
                            and Europe. Those involved call it a movement. It&#39;s possibilities for peace
                            have been hailed by some major religious figures, notably Pope John Paul II
                            and the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet.</p>
                        <p>At a multifaith gathering in Assisi arranged by the Vatican in 1999, the pope
                            called dialogue among religious people a sign of hope for collaboration
                            against social injustices. &#8220;Greater mutual esteem and growing trust,&#8221;
                            he
                            said, &#8220;must lead to still more effective and coordinated common action
                            on
                            behalf of the human family.&#8221;</p>
                        <p> It&#39;s not surprising if all this seems new to some people. Efforts to build
                            ties across religious lines may amount to a movement, but it is a much
                            decentralized one. Furthermore, interfaith work rarely makes the news. In
                            that sense, it would seem to be at a distinct disadvantage compared with its
                            opposite, the use of violence either on behalf of or against a religious
                            group.</p>
                        <p>But, as shown by events in 1965 and 2001, there can be a link between these
                            two tendencies.</p>
                        <p> It was the terrible legacy of the Holocaust that gradually forced major
                            Christian churches to confront anti-Jewish elements in their traditions. In
                            1965, at the close of the Second Vatican Council, the Catholic Church
                            produced a document - the Declaration on the Relationship of the Church to
                            Non-Christian Religions - which, among much else, deplored anti-Semitism and
                            rejected the idea that the Jewish people could be blamed for the death of
                            Jesus.</p>
                        <p> Since then, the Church has gone considerably further, building closer ties
                            with the world&#39;s Jews and affirming that their covenant with God was never
                            revoked.</p>
                        <p>After September 11, 2001 interfaith activity in the United States increased.
                            In the wake of the murderous attacks on New York and Washington by the
                            al-Qaeda terrorist network, people of different faiths sought each other out,
                            arranging joint worship services to share their common grief. </p>
                        <p>In addition, a number of Christians and Jews were moved to help their Muslim
                            neighbors, concerned that Muslims risked falling victim to a violent backlash
                            against Islam and to vandals who would seek out Muslim property and people.
                            In many cities and towns, non-Muslims reached out in small but meaningful
                            ways, standing vigil outside mosques and Islamic schools or offering to go
                            shopping for Muslim women who feared harassment if they left their homes.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, churches, colleges and civic groups began turning to
                            Muslims who felt sufficiently articulate and acculturated to speak about
                            Islam to non-Muslim audiences that might know nothing of the faith beyond the
                            fact that al-Qaeda&#39;s terrorists claimed to act in its name.</p>
                        <p> Last Spring, I met one imam, the spiritual leader at a major urban mosque,
                            who said he had accepted nearly 100 speaking invitations within seven months
                            of the attacks. In an outreach of their own, many mosques flung open their
                            doors, holding open houses to allow non-Muslim neighbors to visit, ask
                            questions and learn about Islam.</p>
                        <p>The speeches and open houses amount to a basic level of interfaith dialogue.
                            How long they will continue is an open question. But their cumulative effect
                            has been to raise the public profile of Muslims in the United States, making
                            their inclusion in interfaith organizations appear all the more necessary.</p>
                        <h3>Finding a Way</h3>
                        <p> Still, even the simplest interfaith activity can be controversial. President
                            Bush&#39;s statements that Islam is a peaceful faith have met with criticism by
                            some conservative Christians.</p>
                        <p> Beyond that, Christians in general are divided over how they should respond
                            theologically to other religions in a world where immigration and new
                            communication technologies have brought people so much closer.</p>
                        <p> In a recent book, Catholic theologian Paul F. Knitter identifies at least
                            four major approaches by Christians to understanding other faiths. These run
                            the gamut from a theology of &#8220;replacement&#8221; (Christianity is to replace
                            all
                            other religions), to one of &#8220;fulfillment&#8221; (Christ fulfills and brings
                            to
                            perfection other religions), to one of &#8220;mutuality&#8221; (Christianity and
                            other
                            religions are mutually respectful), to one of &#8220;acceptance&#8221; (other,
                            different
                            faiths must be accepted).</p>
                        <p> While it may be possible to count different theological approaches to
                            interfaith understanding, the number of interfaith organizations is far
                            harder to estimate. One list offers a &#8220;sampling&#8221; of 26, many carrying
                            the
                            word &#8220;international&#8221; or &#8220;world&#8221; in their titles, but it
                            is far from complete.
                            Some interfaith dialogue takes place under the authority of large Christian
                            organizations. The Vatican, for example, has a staff specializing in
                            inter-religious affairs, as do the World Council of Churches and the National
                            Council of Churches.</p>
                        <p> But a great deal of interfaith work goes on outside such circles, occurring
                            instead at a local level, which lends the movement an energy and staying
                            power that come from grass roots enthusiasm. Local work, often enough, occurs
                            when interested people from different religious groups decide they ought to
                            meet to build closer community ties. Their events may occur in living rooms,
                            in church or synagogue halls or at retreat centers.</p>
                        <p> Some months ago, I dropped in on one such gathering held at a Catholic
                            retreat center in suburban Seattle. About 20 people, Christians, Jews and
                            Muslims, were getting together once a month to talk over religious issues as
                            a way to become better acquainted.</p>
                        <p> That day, one man brought up a biblical story - Jacob wrestling with the
                            angel - that touched off a lively discussion about what different religious
                            traditions have to say about a believer&#39;s right to challenge God. The
                            discussion ran well over an hour but ended civilly. Later, one participant
                            told me the sessions worked because everyone kept away from politics.</p>
                        <p> What brought that particular group together was a desire to talk about
                            religious concepts. But it easily might have been a social issue that united
                            them. Interfaith organizations have been formed to work against homelessness,
                            to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS and to promote peace, among many other
                            causes. The pope&#39;s 1999 speech at Assisi talked about how dialogue can lead
                            to social action. But for some, it can be the other way around. Practical
                            collaboration leads to theological conversation.</p>
                        <p> The Rev. Marcus Braybrooke, co-president of the World Congress of Faiths,
                            based in Oxford, England, has written that what makes the interfaith movement
                            distinctive is the desire of participants to encourage religious people to be
                            respectful and cooperative, rather than competitive with one another.</p>
                        <p> But being cooperative does not mean trying somehow to create a new religious
                            faith. Indeed, many who have participated in interfaith dialogue report that
                            by talking with people of other faiths, they gain a greater knowledge of and
                            commitment to their own, if only because they are forced to think deeply
                            about what they believe.</p>
                        <p><strong>Openness to Other Traditions</strong></p>
                        <p> Joseph C. Hough Jr., the president of Union Theological Seminary in New York,
                            has called recently for Christians to adopt a new theology of other faiths,
                            one that does not fear that openness to other religious traditions will
                            compromise their own faith.</p>
                        <p>&#8220;What is essential for Christian faith is that we know we have seen the
                            face
                            of God in the face of Jesus Christ. It is not essential to believe that no
                            one else has seen God and experienced redemption in another place or time,&#8221;
                            he says. &#8220;For my faith, Jesus Christ is decisive. But I am a Christian
                            who
                            strongly believes that God has always been and now is working everywhere in
                            every human culture to redeem the world. I believe that there is ample
                            evidence in the best of the world&#39;s religions, including our own, that God&#39;s
                            work is effective. Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists and others have been and
                            are being transformed by a powerful vision of god that redeems them with hope
                            and infuses their religious practice with compassion, justice and peace.&#8221;</p>
                        <p> A respect for religious differences, in fact, was a ground rule at a remarkable
                            conference that many regard as the first great interfaith meeting, the World&#39;s
                            Parliament of Religions, held in Chicago in 1993 [<em>sic</em>, 1893]. Among
                            the conference&#39;s stated objectives was a call for fostering &#8220;good
                            understanding&#8221;
                            among different groups of believers, but without encouraging indifference to
                            dogma or trying to create a false unity.</p>
                        <p>Although organized largely by Protestants, the parliament provided a platform
                            for other speakers, most notably from Asia. One man, the Hindu Swami
                            Vivekananda of India, made an extraordinary impression, was lauded by
                            conference delegates and was given enough news coverage to make him an
                            international figure.</p>
                        <p>In his opening speech, Vivekananda offered a vision that continues to inspire
                            some in the interfaith movement in its hope that believers across religious
                            lines may make a positive difference in the world&#39;s condition. Referring to
                            the ringing of the bell that opened the conference, Vivekananda expressed his
                            great hope that the sound would toll &#8220;the death-knell&#8221; of all fanaticism
                            and persecution.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
