                    <div class="entry">
                        <p>Dear Friends of the URI,</p>
                        <p>Greetings of love and peace. In July, I wrote on behalf
                            of URI&#39;s Global Council urging an active observance of the UN&#39;s International
                            Day of Peace this coming September 21. I write now to share news of an
                            observance that is being planned in Chile and to renew my urging to all to
                            find a meaningful way to join a global community focused on peace. The
                            suggestions I offered previously for how you might participate are repeated
                            at the end of this letter.</p>
                        <p>The Spiritual Forum of Santiago for Peace Cooperation Circle is planning a
                            three-day observance for international peace with three different aspects,
                            which are detailed by Global Council Trustee Gerardo Gonzalez:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Prayers by the communities: We are inviting the communities
                                belonging to the various religions and spiritual traditions which are
                                active in Santiago to meet on Saturday 20 or Sunday 21 in their own places
                                (churches, temples, synagogues, mosques, etc.) to pray from their own faith
                                for peace in the world, aware that other communities, built upon other
                                faiths and spiritual traditions are doing the same in other places of our
                                city, our country and the world.</li>
                            <li>Prayers for peace in the world at the schools: Private and
                                public schools are being invited to celebrate the International Day of
                                Peace during the morning of Monday 22 of September, including prayers,
                                which will have an ecumenical or interfaith character in those places where
                                there are students or teachers who belong to different religions or
                                spiritual traditions.</li>
                            <li>Central Ceremony of Interfaith prayers for Peace in the World:
                                The three-day celebration of the International Day of Peace will with a
                                ceremony in the main conference hall of the UN Regional Headquarters
                                (ECLAC) in Santiago, where we will be hosted by the Executive Secretary of
                                the UN Economic and Social Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean.
                                Representatives from around twelve religions and spiritual traditions
                                (Christians, Jews, Moslems, Buddhists, Sikhs, Sufis, Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;s and
                                indigenous
                                traditions) will be seated in a circle at the center of a huge circular
                                hall, surrounded by a multi-religious audience. They will pray one by one,
                                using their own sacred languages, songs and rituals. A minute in silence
                                will follow, allowing all the people attending the ceremony to pray
                                simultaneously for peace. The event will end with all the participants
                                reading in loud voice a commitment to the cause of peace.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>I hope the vision and plans of our Chilean brothers and sisters excites
                            and inspires you. I invite others to share their plans and to share the
                            invitation to join the global community observing the International Day of
                            Peace. Here are a few suggestions of how you might observe the International
                            Day of Peace:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Have a Moment of Silence for peace at 12 noon.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Encourage local religious communities to observe this Moment of
                                    Silence and encourage schools to do this on Friday, Sept. 19, when the
                                    Peace Bell will be rung at the UN.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Hold an International Day of Peace Vigil - a full day of spiritual
                                observance for peace. See
                                <a href="http://www.idpvigil.com/">www.idpvigil.com</a>.
                            </li>
                            <li>Plant a Peace Pole - plant a new one or re-dedicate an existing
                                one.</li>
                            <li>Collaborate with UN offices and missions in your area in commemorating
                                the Day. See
                                <a href="http://www.un.org/events/peaceday">www.un.org/events/peaceday</a>.
                            </li>
                            <li>Encourage your city, state, or national government to issue a
                                proclamation declaring September 21st as a day of peace, nonviolence, and
                                cease-fire. See
                                <a href="http://www.internationaldayofpeace.org/">www.internationaldayofpeace.org</a>
                                for ideas.
                            </li>
                            <li>Ask your local media to publicize the International Day of Peace.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>On behalf of all who yearn for peace, I thank you for your commitment.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
