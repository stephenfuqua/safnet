                            <a class="dead-link">poll released today</a>
                            by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life and the Pew Research Center for
                            the People &#x0026; the Press shows that there has been an important shift in
                            public perceptions of Islam. Fully 44 percent of the American public now
                            believes that Islam is more likely than other religions &#8220;to encourage
                            violence among its believers.&#8221; As recently as March 2002, just 25 percent
                            expressed this view.
                        </p>
                        <p>&#8220;Our findings in this area actually point in different directions,&#8221; said
                            Melissa Rogers, executive director of the Pew Forum. &#8220;On the one hand,
                            there&#39;s certainly an increase in the number of Americans who believe that
                            Islam encourages violence. Yet at the same time, a narrow majority of the
                            public continues to have favorable views of Muslim-Americans, and only 24
                            percent have an unfavorable view.&#8221;</p>
                        <p>The survey on religion in American public life, the third annual poll of
                            its kind, also finds that a majority (53 percent) opposes allowing gays and
                            lesbians to marry legally, compared with 38 percent who support the idea. But
                            opposition to gay marriage has decreased significantly since the mid-1990s,
                            from 65 percent in 1996. The shift in favor of gay marriage is seen in nearly
                            every segment of society, with two significant exceptions &mdash; white evangelical
                            Protestants and African Americans, both of which have maintained their level
                            of opposition since 1996.</p>
                        <p>&#8220;This finding underscores an important fact of American politics,&#8221; said
                            E.J. Dionne Jr., co-chair of the Pew Forum and senior fellow at the Brookings
                            Institution. &#8220;On questions of religion and morality there?s a remarkable
                            overlap in views of white evangelicals and African Americans, yet these
                            groups couldn?t be more different when it comes to questions of partisan
                            politics and President Bush.&#8221;</p>
                        <p>Religious beliefs also play a significant role in Americans&#39; understanding
                            of foreign affairs. More than four-in-ten Americans (44 percent) believe that
                            God gave the land that is now Israel to the Jewish people, while a
                            substantial minority (36 percent) thinks that the modern state of Israel is a
                            &#8220;fulfillment of the biblical prophecy about the second coming of Jesus.&#8221;</p>
                        <p>In other findings:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The public at large is quite comfortable with President Bush&#39;s
                                evocation of faith and what many perceive as his reliance on religious
                                beliefs in making policy decisions. A 62 percent majority thinks Bush
                                strikes the right balance in how much he mentions his religious faith, and
                                nearly as many (58 percent) believe the president?s reliance on religion in
                                policymaking is appropriate.</li>
                            <li>Nearly four-in-ten (38 percent) say they would not vote for a
                                well-qualified Muslim for president, and 17 percent would not vote for a
                                well-qualified evangelical Christian. Fully 52 percent say they would not
                                vote for a well-qualified atheist.</li>
                            <li>Fully 72 percent of Americans agree that the government should provide
                                universal health insurance, even if it means repealing most tax cuts passed
                                since President Bush took office. Democrats overwhelmingly favor this
                                proposal (86 percent-11 percent) and independents largely agree (78
                                percent-19 percent). Even a narrow majority of Republicans (51 percent)
                                favor providing health insurance for all even if it means canceling the tax
                                cuts, while 44 percent disagree.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The nationwide survey of 2,002 adults was conducted June 24-July 8 by the
                            Pew Forum and the Pew Research Center and has a margin of error plus or minus
                            2.5 percentage points.</p>
                        <p>The Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life serves as both a town hall and a
                            clearinghouse of information on issues at the intersection of religion and
                            public affairs. The Forum is strictly non-partisan and does not take
                            positions on legislation or policy matters. It is supported by The Pew
                            Charitable Trusts through a grant to Georgetown University.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
