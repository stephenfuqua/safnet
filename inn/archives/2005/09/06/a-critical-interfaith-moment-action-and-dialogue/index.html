                    <div class="entry">
                        <p>In spite of the tremendous efforts and success of the interfaith movement
                            in promoting a multi-faith pluralistic society based on trust and respect,
                            why has the interfaith circle not expanded as much as many of us expected it
                            to? Why have the relationships not deepened as much? Why is that formal
                            interfaith dialogue only occasionally translates into action? And what can
                            the interfaith community do to make dialogue more relevant and effective?</p>
                        <p>These were some of the key questions that brought many of us involved in
                            interfaith dialogue - more than 100 persons from across the globe, to Geneva,
                            Switzerland in the second week of June 2005 for a World Council of
                            Churches&#39; landmark international interfaith conference titled
                            &quot;Critical Moment in Interreligious Dialogue.&quot;</p>
                        <p>Representatives of virtually all the major world faith communities
                            explored the connections between dialogue and action during the three-day
                            conference. The gathering called for deeper dialogue in common action.</p>
                        <p>This conference was not an opportunity for people of faith to come
                            together to share once again our common humanity - we have done that too many
                            times before. This conference was an opportunity for those engaged in
                            interreligious dialogue to assess it&#39;s achievements of the past, reflect
                            on the relevance and effectiveness of it today, and plan a vision for the
                            future in which dialogue and action will be interlinked.</p>
                        <p>The gathering was a call to move beyond formal dialogue to being able to
                            work with people of faith across religious boundaries in common action so as
                            to reconcile and heal an imperfect and fragile world. Because without
                            justice, our world will not know peace.</p>
                        <p>The need for religions to undertake a &quot;critical and realistic self
                            assessment&quot; while making &quot;overcoming violence in all its
                            forms&quot; an &quot;urgent priority&quot; was stressed by the World Council
                            of Churches (WCC) central committee moderator, His Holiness Catholicos Aram
                            I. In a keynote speech, he emphasized that in the midst of the &quot;moral
                            vacuum&quot; of today&#39;s globalized world, this common action must be
                            grounded in common values. &quot;Values, not interests, must be the guiding
                            principles of interreligious collaboration&quot;, Aram I said.</p>
                        <p>The need for common action was also stressed by WCC General Secretary Rev.
                            Dr. Samuel Kobia in welcoming the conference participants from ten world
                            religions. After almost 35 years of involvement in dialogue, the WCC has
                            &quot;come to realize the interreligious truth of an old ecumenical
                            principle: that which we can do together we should not do separately,&quot;
                            he said.</p>
                        <p>The conference opened on June 7 with a Sikh spiritual reflection. The
                            first day of the conference stressed the call for credible dialogue with
                            common action. The second day was devoted to exploring the relationship
                            between dialogue and action. On the last day of the conference, religious
                            leaders from across the world focused on the growing global Christian -
                            Muslim tensions. Discussions were held on the future of interreligious
                            dialogue and initial steps were taken to develop a non-sectarian common
                            declaration that may guide interfaith dialogue in action.</p>
                        <p>The conference participants agreed that &quot;recasting interreligious
                            dialogue as a practice of humility and hope offers a way of building greater
                            trust&#8230; Together may we seize this critical moment and help transform its
                            perils into a pilgrimage of faith that will guide us to a more just,
                            compassionate and peaceful future.&quot;</p>
                        <p>About 130 participants of diverse faiths and traditions, including
                            academics, religious scholars, humanitarian workers, activists and
                            journalists attended the gathering. The conference program included a series
                            of presentations and dialogue sessions on the themes of &quot;thinking
                            together&quot;, &quot;assessing the present&quot;, and &quot;imagining the
                            future&quot;. More information about the conference can be accessed at

                        <p>Greetings Dr Tarunjit Singh Butalia and Friends, respectively,</p>
                        <p>May Peace Be With You.</p>
                        <p>Dr Tarunjit Singh Butalia, your sharing of your experience at the recent interreligious
                            council facilitated several months ago by the World Council of Churches is valued and
                            appreciated. </p>
                        <p>The notion of progressing beyond the pleasantries of polite acknowledgment of each other’s
                            humanity and worthiness is appropriate. One methodology with which to cultivate such
                            progression is through simple pragmatism. It is in this respect that this InterFaith
                            Settlement is offered. </p>
                        <p>This InterFaith Settlement is an intentional community that welcomes adherents from the
                            predominant religious traditions of the World, including Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism,
                            Christianity, and Islam. This InterFaith Settlement also respectfully welcomes adherents
                            from other religious traditions of the World, including Sikhism and the Bahai’i. This
                            InterFaith Settlement is provided as a means of facilitating pragmatic interaction between
                            the respective adherents of the many religious traditions of the World, and to provide the
                            benefit of the learning that results from this pragmatic interaction to the aggregate of the
                            respective adherents of the respective religious traditions of the World and, indeed, to all
                            individuals throughout the Universe.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable
                    civilization, a global interfaith movement has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
