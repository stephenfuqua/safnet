                            <p><em>The [Bush] Administration&rsquo;s sudden opposition to&hellip;the
                                    international target for rich nations to contribute 0.7 percent of GNP
                                    toward poverty reduction places an unwelcome obstacle in the path toward a
                                    more stable and secure world&hellip;I am deeply mindful of the need to use
                                    government resources to combat terrorism, but one of the most stinging
                                    lessons of our time is that the roots of terrorism and conflict most often
                                    can be found in those places where poverty and sickness abound and hope is
                                    lost&hellip;For the U.S. to now oppose that long-held target further
                                    undermines our nation&rsquo;s international credibility, weakens rather
                                    than strengthens global security, and does violence to all of our efforts
                                    to respond to God&rsquo;s passionate desire for reconciliation and the
                                    well-being of all people.</em></p>
                            <p>The Most Rev. Frank T. Griswold

                        <p>During a 4 p.m. interfaith service of music and prayer, featured speakers

                            will travel to New York to present the group&rsquo;s communiqu&eacute; to the

                        <p>I am writing to you at this time because you are having your workshop at the same time (W/E)
                            and the same city as The Peace Alliance, another national campaign that works closely with
                            the United Nations, who through UNESCO passed a ten year moratorium to create a
                            &#8220;Culture of Peace&#8221; for the children of the world.
                            The Peace Alliance is an organization whose goals are twofold. One of them involves a
                            campaign to get the US cabinet level Department of Peace legislation passed through
                            Congress. I believe this is the most important legislation of our time concerning changing
                            the culture of violence which we have all grown up in.
                            The Honorable Congressman Dennis Kucinich is reintroducing this inspired Bill on Wednesday,
                            September 14th. I say inspired because it covers all the issues that concern us today. It
                            shall involve educating US, giving US tools to have better experiences with our everyday
                            conflicts and communications encouraging a change in our violent and hurtfull dialogue,
                            which is many times an unconscious misrepresentation of what we are really feeling. Once we
                            learn this as adults we can teach our young from birth and again when they enter
                            institutions for more formal education, we can hopefully create a &#8220;Culture of
                            Peace.&#8221; I perceive this legislation as a &#8220;calling&#8221; to our higher power,
                            for love and respect for every living thing on our fragile planet.
                            It would be wonderful if both our groups could converge not only when meeting with the
                            dignitaries of the United Nations in New York City, but converge on the members of the House
                            of Representatives and the Senate while we are all learning to be all we can be in the
                            Capital City of Washington DC.
                            After reading Deepak Chopra&#8217;s book, &#8220;The Spontaneous Fulfillment of
                            Desire,&#8221; I truly believe in the synchronicity of events and Providence.I also believe
                            in the power of one. We all have something to give no matter how small it may seem. Please
                            send this letter on to the powers that be in your organization because I think a partnership
                            will be powerful.

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable

                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
