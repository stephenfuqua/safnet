                        <p>
                            The Conference on Interfaith Cooperation for Peace was organized under a
                            tripartite partnership among governments, the United Nations system and
                            civil society representing religious non-governmental organizations. This
                            tripartite conference is of historic significance bringing together three
                            main sectors that have much to gain in working together. The Conference
                            was held on 22 June 2005 immediately preceding the informal interactive
                            Hearings of the President of the General Assembly with nongovernmental
                            organizations, civil society organizations and the private sector in

                            The Conference aimed at enhancing interfaith cooperation, promoting the
                            culture of peace and dialogue among civilizations, as well as translating
                            shared values into practical action, to achieve sustainable peace in the
                            twenty-first century. The organizers of the Conference drew inspiration
                            from the United Nations Millennium Declaration and the recent efforts to
                            promote interfaith cooperation at the international, inter-regional,
                            regional and national levels.

                                More deliberate and strategic efforts in interreligious dialogue and
                                cooperation are needed to foster relationships and interdependencies
                                and advance understanding between diverse peoples, cultures and
                                religions.

                                Issues of peace and justice, human rights, religious freedom, poverty,
                                education, sustainable development, the rights and well being of
                                children, the equal dignity of men and women, indigenous peoples and
                                the protection of the environment are our common concerns. The
                                partnership of governments, the UN and religious NGOs is of crucial
                                significance in the achievement of internationally agreed development
                                goals, including the MDGs.

                                Interreligious dialogue and cooperation are essential and can
                                facilitate the work of enhancing human welfare, freedom and progress
                                everywhere.

                                    commonalities among peoples and civilizations contribute to the
                                    peaceful resolution of conflicts and disputes, and reduce the potential
                                    for animosity, clash and even violence.

                                The tripartite conference calls upon the High Level Plenary Meeting of
                                the General Assembly in September 2005 to take into account the
                                conclusions and recommendations of this conference. The High Level
                                Plenary Meeting in September 2005 should recognize that dialogues among
                                civilizations, cultures, and religions constitute vital contributions
                                towards the promotion of a just and sustainable peace. The 2005
                                September Summit should call for an expansion and deepening of the
                                relationship between the United Nations and civil society, including
                                religious NGOs.

                                Nations system and civil society, should undertake practical actions in
                                the fields of education and the media, to foster understanding,
                                tolerance and cooperation between peoples of different religions and
                                beliefs so as to overcome intolerance and combat stereotypes and
                                misperceptions. Particular reference is made to the Program of Action
                                under the Global Agenda for the Dialogue Among Civilizations (2001).

                                An open-ended tripartite consultative group composed of representatives
                                from Member States, the United Nations system, and non-governmental
                                organizations should be formed to follow-up on the conclusions and
                                recommendations of this Conference with an emphasis on practical
                                actions. The open-ended tripartite consultative group should tap
                                available resources and abilities, and develop ways and means to affirm
                                the role of interreligious and intercultural cooperation in attaining a
                                just and sustainable peace through the mechanisms already available in
                                the United Nations system, such as the efforts to promote a Culture of
                                Peace and a Dialogue among Civilizations, the intercultural and
                                interreligious work of UNESCO and the annual International Day of Peace
                                on 21 September. The openended tripartite consultative group should
                                also identify new ways to address interreligious, intercultural and
                                intercivilizational issues and concerns, including the opportunity and
                                mechanism for religious leaders to speak, interact and respond more
                                clearly and quickly in times of violence, crises and conflict.

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable
                    civilization, a global interfaith movement has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
