                            Rabbi Arthur Waskow of the Shalom Center points out the confluence of
                            holy days from many different religions in October, encouraging faith
                            communities to use that time for shared celebration, prayer, reflection,
                            and peacebuilding.

                    <p class="author">By Rabbi Arthur Waskow </p>
                    <div class="entry">
                        <p>
                            At a moment of increasing religious war, violence, and repression, God
                            has given our spiritual and religious traditions a gift of time:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During October 2005, an unusual confluence of sacred moments in many
                            different traditions invites us to pray with or alongside each other,
                            share food and stories, and work together for peace, justice, human
                            rights, and the healing of our wounded earth.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The sacred Muslim lunar month of Ramadan and the sacred Jewish lunar
                            month of Tishrei, which includes the High Holy Days and Sukkot, both
                            begin October 3-4.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And there is more:&nbsp; October 4 is the Feast of St. Francis of Assisi
                            (who almost alone of all Christian leaders of his generation opposed the
                            Crusades and studied with Islamic teachers, as well as connecting deeply
                            with all the creatures of the earth); October 2 is&nbsp; Gandhi&#8217;s
                            birthday, and is also Worldwide (Protestant/ Orthodox) Communion Sunday.
                            In mid-October, there are important Buddhist and Hindu festivals.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There is much that we could do to heal the world during this sacred
                            season made up of sacred times:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Most powerfully, perhaps,&nbsp; from sunrise to sunset on the day that
                            for Muslims is one of the fast days of Ramadan and for Jews is the fast
                            day of Yom Kippur &mdash; October 13 &mdash; Christians and indeed all
                            Americans could also observe a&nbsp; Fast for Reflection, Repentance,
                            Reconciliation, and Renewal.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All of us could learn from the passage of Isaiah that in Jewish tradition
                            is read on&nbsp; Yom Kippur morning. God, speaking through Isaiah, says,
                            &#8220;Do you think the fast that I demand this day is to bow down your head
                            like a bulrush? No! The fast I demand is that you feed the poor, house
                            the homeless, clothe the naked, and break off the handcuffs on your
                            prisoners.&#8221;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So for our generation, this October 13 fast could be dedicated to serving
                            God not through prayer alone but also through committing ourselves that
                            later in the month, we will undertake some action in which the different
                            communities together embody God&#8217;s commands to <i><b>Seek peace, feed the
                                    poor, heal the earth.</b></i>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Other possibilities for action:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Churches could invite other congregations to join in learning
                                about,&nbsp; celebrating,&nbsp; and acting on the teachings of Francis
                                of Assisi.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Jews could invite others into the Sukkah, a leafy hut that is open to
                                the wind and rain. Traditionally, &#8220;sacred guests&#8221; are invited in and
                                the ancient Rabbis taught that during Sukkot, blessings are invoked
                                upon &#8220;the seventy nations&#8221; of the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; Traditional
                                prayers implore God to &#8220;spread the sukkah of shalom&#8221; over
                                us.&nbsp;&nbsp; These are perfect rubrics for peacemaking among the
                                children of Abraham and all humanity with each other and with all the
                                earth.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Muslims could host Iftar - a break-fast&nbsp; meal &#8212; for other
                                communities, after nightfall on any of the evenings of Ramadan. And
                                they could invite others to join in celebrating some aspects of Eid
                                el-Fitr (the feast at the end of Ramadan), and Jews and Christians
                                could (as in Morocco) bring food to that celebration.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul class="noindent">
                            <li>
                                Synagogues could set aside a time during Yom Kippur or the Shabbat just
                                before, or another special time during the month, to read and discuss
                                with Muslims the Torah&#8217;s story (Gen. 25: 7-11) of the joining of Isaac
                                and Ishmael to bury their father Abraham, and then to achieve
                                reconciliation at the Well of the Living One Who Sees Me.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Our communities could together take some action during the month to
                                protect human rights, heal the earth, and seek peace in the whole
                                region where Abraham, Hagar, and Sarah sojourned.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                            A call to all Americans to join in an October 13 fast and to create
                            shared multireligious local and regional events during the month was
                            initiated by The Shalom Center, with The Tent of Abraham, Hagar, and
                            Sarah. It has been endorsed by the National Council of Churches; the
                            Islamic Society of North America; Pax Christi; ALEPH: Alliance for Jewish
                            Renewal and its rabbinic affilate Ohalah; the Jewish Committee for
                            Isaiah&#8217;s Vision (an ad hoc committee made up of more than one hundred
                            rabbis and other Jewish leaders), and a number of local and regional
                            groups. To explore your own participation in this effort, write

                            In 2006 and 2007, Tishrei, Ramadan, and St. Francis&#8217; day will again
                            coincide.&nbsp; With three successive years of making sacred connection,
                            perhaps we can learn to continue even when the calendar is not so filled
                            with God&#8217;s surprise.

                        <p>Dear Rabbi Waskow:</p>
                        <p>As a Christian, I believe (as the Jews) that we need to care deeply about the souls of men,
                            women, and children all over the world. However, I would like to comment on your desire that
                            religious communities would take actions that &#8220;together embody God’s commands to seek
                            peace, feed the poor, heal the earth.&#8221; God, through Isaiah, has just been quoted in a
                            passage that commands each one fasting to:</p>
                        <p> * loose the bands of wickedness</p>
                        <p> * undo the heavy burdens</p>
                        <p> * let the oppressed go free</p>
                        <p> * break every yoke</p>
                        <p> * deal your bread to the hungry</p>
                        <p> * bring into your house the poor that are cast out</p>
                        <p> * cover the naked</p>
                        <p> * hide not yourself from your own flesh.</p>
                        <p>This is good and acceptable, but what about the command to &#8220;heal the earth&#8221;? It
                            is absent. God promises in 2 Chronicles 7:14 that He will heal His people&#8217;s land
                            Himself if they follow the command to &#8220;humble themselves, and pray, and seek My face,
                            and turn from their wicked ways.&#8221; God&#8217;s people are those called by His name, as
                            expressed earlier in the same verse. Being a Rabbi, the writer will know that YHWH is
                            speaking in this passage of Scripture. Those called by YHWH&#8217;s name are His people. Yet
                            the Muslims worship another god rather than the true Lord of the Bible, in that Allah was
                            already worshiped by an idolatrous religion before Muhammed founded Islam. Only the
                            biblical, original Judeo-Christian ethic teaches true worship of YHWH (manifest as Jesus
                            according to Christianity) as He truly is. I know not what course others may take, but the
                            God of the Bible is the only way if He is to be believed at all. &#8220;I the LORD [YHWH]
                            thy God am a jealous God,&#8221; He says in Exo. 20:5 and Deut 5:9 (see also Exo. 34:14,
                            Deut. 4:24). He will not share His glory with the gods of other faiths (see Isaiah 42:8). I
                            know that you are trying to promote peace between people, but God&#8217;s prophets preached
                            persuasion when the people turned to other gods. This was not done out of intolerance, but
                            because of a deep love and concern for the souls of their fellowhumans. I believe it is not
                            exclusive to say that Jesus Christ (YHWH) is the only way, because the Bible teaches that
                            converts should be treated just as though they had always been God&#8217;s people. Although
                            Orthodox Jews do not believe the books of the New Testament to be God&#8217;s Word, I hope
                            that you will understand how the following verses harmonize with the Old Testament message:
                            &#8220;And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols?&#8230;as God hath said,
                            &#8216;I will dwell in them [meaning in God&#8217;s people], and walk in them&#8230;&#8217;
                            Wherefore come out from among them [the heathen], and be ye separatem saith the
                            Lord&#8230;&#8221; (taken from 2 Corinthians 6:16-17). This does not mean to disassociate
                            with everyone who is not of our faith, but it means rather to be separate (i.e., different)
                            from them and not to form our closest relationships (such as marriage and other close
                            unions) with them. Jesus Christ ate with sinners and showed compassion on them. Many people
                            whom He healed never converted to His religion. Yet he still healed them and loved them. I
                            don&#8217;t believe in interfaithism, but I do believe in reaching out in LOVE, rather than
                            violence, to share my faith in Jesus.

                        <p>Kris - thank you for expressing your clear devotion and passion. I find it interesting that
                            you cite Allah as diety who was worshipped by idolaters before the advent of Muhammad; is it
                            not true that the God of the Old Testament was worshipped by idolators at the time of Moses?
                            In fact, historical research <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahweh#Possible_origins"
                                rel="nofollow">shows</a> that &#8220;YHWH&#8221; may be closely linked with several
                            regional deities in Mesopotamia, long before coming to be the distinctive God of the
                            Israelites.

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable

                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
