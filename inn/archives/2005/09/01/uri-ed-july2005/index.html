                        <p>Dear Friends of the URI,</p>
                        <p>Greetings of love and peace.</p>
                        <p>I begin this letter in Seoul, Korea at the end of a transformative week in
                            URI&#39;s life. Seventy members of URI&#39;s 2005 and 2008 Global
                            Councils, Global Staff and special guests have been privileged to share here
                            a week of spirit-filled work, profound solidarity with a nation yearning for
                            peaceful reunification, gratitude and celebration. We journeyed to Korea from
                            23 countries, as members of over 20 religions, spiritual expressions and
                            indigenous traditions. I want to share some major accomplishments and
                            highlights of this week that I believe marks a moment of major maturing for
                            URI:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>A rousing celebration of URI&#39;s fifth anniversary and the 60th
                                anniversary of the UN Charter.</li>
                            <li>Daily grounding in sacred openings offered by trustees and staff from
                                each of eight regions and diverse faith traditions, and in the Preamble,
                                Purpose and Principles of URI&#39;s Charter.</li>
                            <li>The successful transition from URI&#39;s first Global Council to our
                                second, signaling the stability of our organization while incorporating
                                vibrant new leadership, including two remarkable young women, one from Iran
                                and one from Jordan;</li>
                            <li>The new GC&#39;s unanimous commitment to offer individual financial
                                support annually to the global URI, in addition to what they already
                                contribute to support URI locally and regionally;</li>
                            <li>The election of Yoland Trevino, a Mayan woman born in Guatemala, and
                                Mussie Hailu, an Orthodox Christian from Ethiopia, as Chair and Vice-chair
                                of the new GC;</li>
                            <li>URI&#39;s expanded global reach through the creation of a Senior
                                Advisory Council as a vehicle for ongoing leadership and support by our
                                outgoing GC Trustees, and strengthening the connectedness and cooperative
                                efforts of URI&#39;s growing Global Staff;</li>
                            <li>The universal commitment to fundraising as critical to URI&#39;s
                                development, with much conversation about regional fundraising efforts and
                                work to lay the foundation for a major endowment campaign to secure
                                reliable funding for URI&#39;s core operations;</li>
                            <li>Trustees and staff in eight regions engaged in successful teambuilding
                                and planning for URI&#39;s future development;</li>
                            <li>The peace pilgrimage in solidarity with our Korean hosts to the
                                Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that divides Korea, and the
                                <a href="http://www.uri.org/option,com_docman/task,doc_download/gid,73/Itemid,160.html">
                                    peace proclamation</a> for the Korean people and leaders and the
                                international community;
                            </li>
                            <li>The briefing about URI&#39;s presence at the UN, follow-up
                                conversations that will connect URI leaders with key policy makers from
                                their countries, including Germany and the Philippines, and a unanimous
                                commitment to have URI&#39;s global network observe the UN&#39;s
                                International Day of Peace, September 21, annually;</li>
                            <li>The new initiative to create and implement a plan to develop the URI
                                presence in the &ldquo;Stans&rdquo;, to be led by a new volunteer staff
                                person in Tajikistan;</li>
                            <li>The commitment of funds to purchase a computer and ensure internet
                                access and English lessons to support the full participation of an
                                Indigenous trustee from Latin America;</li>
                            <li>The extraordinary hospitality and rich cultural and artistic banquet
                                provided by our host, Ven. Jinwol Lee, supported by an inspiring staff,
                                most of them youth.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>In closing, I&#39;d like to share a little more about the moving
                            pilgrimage we made to the DMZ. On a gray day, we stood at an observation post
                            overlooking this narrow strip of land which for too long has divided one
                            Korea into two countries. The pilgrimage was especially meaningful because of
                            our Korean colleagues: one spoke of not having had any contact with either of
                            his parents for over 50 years and not knowing if they are still alive;
                            another told the moving story of her father, then twelve years old, escaping
                            by himself through a war zone, from the North to the South, only to discover
                            that his four year old sister was still in the North. He returned by himself,
                            found his sister and brought her with him to freedom.</p>
                        <p>We stood in solidarity and prayer with these extraordinary people, and
                            with all Koreans who hold such a deep yearning for the peaceful reunification
                            of their country, expressed in the many prayers and hopes attached to the
                            chain link fence at the end of the Freedom Bridge, leading from South to
                            North. There, standing in the South, looking to the North, we read the
                            <a href="http://www.uri.org/option,com_docman/task,doc_download/gid,73/Itemid,160.html">
                                Peace Proclamation</a>, which expressed our commitment to help both Koreas
                            build cultures of peace, justice and healing as they work to reunite their
                            country.
                        </p>
                        <p>There are many other stories to tell about our remarkable week in Korea.
                            But for now I want you to know that in Korea we saw URI take a major step
                            forward in our growth as a diverse, effective global organization and a major
                            step toward having a voice on issues of major global significance.</p>
                        <p>Whoever you are and wherever you are, I invite you to join in the ongoing
                            celebration of what we members of URI have accomplished together and in the
                            shared commitment to the accomplishments yet to come.</p>
                        <p>Love,</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable
                    civilization, a global interfaith movement has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
