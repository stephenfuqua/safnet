                    <div class="lead">
                        <p>Reacting to the bombings in London, the Fiqh Council of North America on July 28 became the
                            first known Muslim group to issue a <i>fatwa</i> against terrorism and religious extremism.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p class="author">By Fiqh Council of North America</p>
                    <div class="entry">
                        <p><a id="more-70"></a></p>
                        <p>
                            The Fiqh Council of North America wishes to reaffirm Islam&#8217;s absolute
                            condemnation of terrorism and religious extremism.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Islam strictly condemns religious extremism and the use of violence
                            against innocent lives. There is no justification in Islam for extremism
                            or terrorism. Targeting civilians&iacute; life and property through
                            suicide bombings or any other method of attack is <i>haram</i> &mdash; or
                            forbidden &mdash; and those who commit these barbaric acts are criminals,
                            not &#8220;martyrs.&#8221;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The <i>Qur&#8217;an</i>, Islam&#8217;s revealed text, states: &#8220;Whoever kills a person
                            [unjustly] it is as though he has killed all mankind. And whoever saves a
                            life, it is as though he had saved all mankind.&#8221; (<i>Qur&#8217;an</i>, 5:32)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Prophet Muhammad said there is no excuse for committing unjust acts: &#8220;Do
                            not be people without minds of your own, saying that if others treat you
                            well you will treat them well, and that if they do wrong you will do
                            wrong to them. Instead, accustom your selves to do good if people do good
                            and not to do wrong (even) if they do evil.&#8221; (Al-Tirmidhi)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            God mandates moderation in faith and in all aspects of life when He
                            states in the <i>Qur&#8217;an</i>: &#8220;We made you to be a community of the middle
                            way, so that (with the example of your lives) you might bear witness to
                            the truth before all mankind.&#8221; (<i>Qur&#8217;an</i>, 2:143 )
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In another verse, God explains our duties as human beings when he says:
                            &#8220;Let there arise from among you a band of people who invite to
                            righteousness, and enjoin good and forbid evil.&#8221; (<i>Qur&#8217;an</i>, 3:104)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Islam teaches us to act in a caring manner to all of God&#8217;s creation. The
                            Prophet Muhammad, who is described in the <i>Qur&#8217;an</i> as &#8220;a mercy to
                            the worlds&#8221; said: &#8220;All creation is the family of God, and the person most
                            beloved by God (is the one) who is kind a nd caring toward His family.&#8221;
                        </p>
                        <p> In the light of the teachings of the <i>Qur&#8217;an</i> and Sunnah we clearly
                            and strongly state:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            1. All acts of terrorism targeting civilians are haram (forbidden) in
                            Islam.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            2. It is haram for a Muslim to cooperate with any individual or group
                            that is involved in any act of terrorism or violence.
                        </p>
                        <p> 3. It is the civic and religious duty of Muslims to cooperate with law
                            enforcement authorities to protect the lives of all civilians.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We issue this fatwa following the guidance of our scripture, the
                            <i>Qur&#8217;an</i>, and the teachings of our Prophet Muhammad &mdash; peace be
                            upon him. We urge all people to resolve all conflicts in just and
                            peaceful manners.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We pray for the defeat of extremism and terrorism. We pray for the safety
                            and security of our country, the United States, and its people. We pray
                            for the safety and security of all inhabitants of our planet. We pray
                            that interfaith harmony and cooperat ion prevail both in the United
                            States and all around the globe.

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable
                    civilization, a global interfaith movement has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
