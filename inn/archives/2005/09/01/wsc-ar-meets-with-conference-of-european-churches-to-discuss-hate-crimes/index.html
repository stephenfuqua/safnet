                            It is a sad mark of the persistence of ethnic, cultural, and religious
                            bigotry that so many people continue to paint all Muslims as fanatics and
                            terrorists, as evidenced by violence against individual Muslims and their
                            religious institutions. It is equally disturbing that the same brush is
                            often applied to non-Muslims of North African, Middle Eastern, and Indian
                            origin, particularly to Sikhs.

                        <p>
                            The Secretary General of
                            <a href="http://www.worldsikhcouncil.org/">World Sikh Council</a> -
                            America Region (WSC-AR), Dr. Tarunjit Singh, met with the President of
                            the Conference of European Churches, Rev. Jean-Arnold de Clermont, on
                            July 11, 2005 to share concerns over the recent increase in hate crimes
                            against Sikhs and Muslims in Europe following the London bomb attacks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The meeting was held in Indianapolis, Indiana during the annual
                            conference of the National Association of Ecumenical and Interreligious
                            Staff (NAEIS), July 9 - 13.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Dr. Singh shared with Rev. Clermont the recent attacks on religious
                            minorities, including Sikhs and Muslims, in Europe and called upon the
                            Conference of European Churches to work more vigorously with religious
                            minorities of Europe in reducing religious intolerance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Rev. Clermont expressed dismay at the incidents of hate and violence in
                            Europe and offered to work with Sikhs in Europe.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Both leaders agreed that the Sikh and Christian communities of Europe
                            need to be able to work together on issues of common interest to prevent
                            religious intolerance and hate crimes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The NAEIS annual conference also adopted a resolution on July 12 that
                            stated, &#8220;As we unequivocally condemn that horrible act [terrorist attack
                            in London], we are equally repulsed that others would use violence to
                            exact revenge. This violence goes against all that our religious
                            communities teach us about embracing the hands of our neighbors and
                            living in peace and respect. In this challenging time, we call on all
                            people of faith and goodwill to engage in more inter-religious dialogue
                            and collaborative action and pray that this may lead to greater
                            understanding and awareness.&#8221;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Rev. Clermont and Dr. Singh also discussed the French ban on religious
                            symbols in pubic schools. Rev. Clermont, who is also the President of the
                            French Protestant Federation, called upon the French Sikh community to
                            work with his organization in resolving the issue. During the NAEIS
                            conference, Dr. Singh had expressed concern over the adoption of similar
                            laws by other European nations.

                            In response to the small explosions reported today from London, the
                            WSC-AR calls upon Sikh Gurdwaras, organizations, and individuals in the
                            US and Europe to be cautious of incidents of hate, prejudice, and
                            violence, and to promptly report all such occurrences to the local police
                            and civil rights organizations.

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable
                    civilization, a global interfaith movement has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
