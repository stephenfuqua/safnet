                        <p>In a beautiful statement, religious leaders in Albania &mdash; one of the
                            poorest nations in Europe, and one of the last released from Communism
                            &mdash; proclaim the importance of religious harmony and shared values while
                            carefully enunciated their own distinctness. The preservation of the belief
                            in uniqueness of one&#39;s own religion is one of the most difficult public
                            relations issues faced by the interfaith movement. Here we have an amazing
                            model of how to achieve this while emphasizing the need for cooperation.
                            &quot;Let us treat others as we would wish them to treat us.&quot;</p>

                        <p>The religious leaders from the Albanian Islamic Community, Orthodox
                            Church, Roman Catholic Church and Bektashi Community signed an historic
                            &ldquo;Statement of Shared Moral Commitment&rdquo; on March 18, 2005. These
                            religious leaders of Albania, whose communities endured great suffering
                            during the Cold War, jointly acknowledged their diverse faith traditions,
                            affirmed their shared moral values, and committed themselves to work together
                            to promote a vibrant civil society in Albania. They also called upon the
                            relevant national authorities to protect religious freedom.</p>
                        <p>During the signing ceremony moderated by the World Conference of Religions
                            for Peace and attended by leading national figures and representatives of
                            many foreign embassies, the Statement was presented by the religious leaders
                            to the Albanian peoples. The religious leaders pledged to work together on
                            the development of civil society and the growth of religious freedom. During
                            the ceremony, The Prime Minister of Albania, H. E. Fatos Nano, declared his
                            support for the multi-religious initiative, stating that &ldquo;these
                            religious leaders are far more important (to Albania) than any political
                            officer.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>The event marked an important step in a year long process facilitated by
                            Religions for Peace designed to support the leadership of the heads of the
                            Albanian religious communities. Speaking on behalf of the Albanian religious
                            leaders, the Orthodox Archbishop Anastasios expressed appreciation for the
                            partnership with Religions for Peace, noting the complementary strengths of
                            multi-religious cooperation on national, regional and international levels.
                            Religions for Peace, the world&rsquo;s largest multi-religious organization,
                            has worked to facilitate the formation of action-oriented multi-religious
                            councils throughout Southeast Europe. In November 2004, the European Council
                            of Religions for Peace convened a major meeting in Brussels of Southeast
                            European religious leaders around the topic of religious harmony in the
                            region.</p>

                        <p><b>STATEMENT OF SHARED MORAL COMMITMENT</b></p>
                        <p><b><i>18 March, 2005</i></b></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In view of the long, peaceful and fruitful co-existence of traditional
                                religious communities in Albania;</li>
                            <li>Bearing in mind that after a common suffering of almost 50-years of
                                total prohibition of faith and religious institutions, the values and ideas
                                of our faith traditions could survive thanks to enormous sacrifice;</li>
                            <li>Recognising that, with gratitude to God, the period of repression is
                                behind us and religious life can once again blossom in Albania in its
                                various forms and retake its hereditary place in a democratic society;</li>
                            <li>But at the same time, recognizing the reality of religious disharmony
                                in ethnic, social and political conflicts in many parts of the world and
                                even within our region;</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>We, the traditional religious communities in Albania: the Muslim
                            Community, the Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania (Orthodox Church),
                            the Catholic Church, and the Bektashi Community, feel called upon to point
                            the way to the future and have made the decision to release the following
                            joint statement.</p>
                        <p>We recognize and accept that our religious communities differ from each
                            other, and that each of us feels called to observe their own faith.&nbsp; At
                            the same time, we recognize that our religious and spiritual traditions hold
                            many values in common, and that these shared values can serve as an authentic
                            basis for mutual esteem, cooperation, and free common living throughout the
                            territory of Albania.</p>
                        <p>We, the Muslim Community, the Orthodox Church, the Catholic Church, and
                            the Bektashi Community are proud of our history of multi-religious
                            co-existence in Albania. We proclaim that the dignity of the human person and
                            human value is a gift of God. Our faiths, each in their own way, call us to
                            respect each person&rsquo;s fundamental human rights. Discrimination and
                            violence against persons or the violation of their basic rights, for us,
                            breaks not only man-made laws, but also God&rsquo;s law.</p>
                        <p>As representatives of the respective religious communities we express our
                            conviction that, after rebuilding our religious communities, we have now
                            entered into a new phase of challenges. These challenges require us to
                            strengthen and renew our efforts to promote the traditionally good relations
                            as well as dialogue and cooperation among ourselves, while also enhancing the
                            role of our religious communities as important institutions in our society.
                            With this statement we pledge the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We will continue to commit ourselves to pray for and to promote
                                tolerance, coexistence, and peace both within our own communities and for
                                the entire Albanian society. We also pledge ourselves to continue the
                                promotion of a &ldquo;climate of peace&rdquo; within our communities by
                                stressing to our own officials that preaching must not cause religious
                                hatred;We will continue to educate all persons to understand and respect
                                our different faith traditions in order to prevent ignorance and fear from
                                fuelling discrimination and violence. To this end, we must ensure that
                                school curriculum and textbooks treat each religious tradition in an equal
                                and open manner;We will continue to be open to cooperation with other civic
                                and social organizations to carry out common activities for which we share
                                a common concern;</li>
                            <li>We will continue to cooperate through reciprocal meetings to maintain
                                and promote inter-religious understanding in Albania and in the
                                region;</li>
                            <li>We will continue to pledge ourselves to find the means to provide
                                assistance for all those who suffer in our society;</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Further, we, the Muslim Community, the Orthodox Church, the Catholic
                            Church, and the Bektashi Community call on civil authorities at the local and
                            state level:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To protect the freedom of all authorized representatives or religious
                                leaders to fulfil their mission;</li>
                            <li>To protect the traditional religious communities from any person or
                                group (within or outside the community) who tries to misuse the name and/or
                                property, seals, and symbols of a religious community. In such cases we
                                believe it is necessary that the state, under the rule of law, firmly
                                intervenes in favour of the welfare of these communities;</li>
                            <li>To provide support for the development of a strong civil society
                                through adopting appropriate laws, financial regulations, and other
                                policies that will promote the necessary environment for religious
                                communities and other civic organizations to thrive;</li>
                            <li>To furthermore promote and practice democracy, human rights and rule of
                                law;</li>
                            <li>To work towards a resolution on the legal status of religious
                                communities and on the restitution of property of religious communities
                                that was nationalized or expropriated in the past;</li>
                            <li>To develop media practices that do not promote division, mistrust and
                                hostility among peoples, but can contribute to the building of a healthy
                                democratic society. In this context we also call on the media to be fair
                                and respectful in their coverage of religious topics;</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Finally, we call on the entire Albanian society to return once again to
                            the values of faith, protection of life, and human dignity. Let us treat
                            others as we would wish them to treat us.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable
                    civilization, a global interfaith movement has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
