                            The Archbishop of Canterbury warns that the price of our continued failure

                    <p class="author">By The Rt. Rev. Rowan Williams<br />Archbishop ofCanterbury</p>
                    <p class="postdate">17 April 2005</p>
                    <div class="entry">
                        <p><a id="more-68"></a>
                        <p>Too often in recent decades, the two big &quot;e&quot; words - ecology and
                            economy - have been used as though they represented opposing concerns. Yes,
                            we should be glad to do more about the environment, if only this didn&#39;t
                            interfere with economic development and with the liberty of people and
                            nations to create wealth in whatever ways they can.</p>
                        <p>Or, we should be glad to address environmental issues if we could be sure
                            that we had first resolved the challenge of economic injustice within and
                            between societies. So from both left and right there has often been a
                            persistent sense that it isn&#39;t proper or possible to tackle both
                            together, let alone to give a different sort of priority to ecological
                            matters.</p>
                        <p>But this separation or opposition has come to look like a massive mistake.
                            It has been said that &quot;the economy is a wholly owned subsidiary of the
                            environment&quot;. The earth itself is what ultimately controls economic
                            activity because it is the source of the materials upon which economic
                            activity works.</p>
                        <p>That is why economy and ecology cannot be separated. Ecological fallout
                            from economic development is in no way an &quot;externality&quot; as the
                            economic jargon has it; it is a positive depletion of real wealth, of human
                            and natural capital. To seek to have economy without ecology is to try to
                            manage an environment with no knowledge or concern about how it works in
                            itself - to try to formulate human laws in abstraction from or ignorance of
                            the laws of nature.</p>
                        <p>It is time to look seriously at the full implications of this. We need to
                            start by recognising that social collapse is a real possibility. When we
                            speak about environmental crisis, we are not to think only of spiralling
                            poverty and mortality, but about brutal and uncontainable conflict. An
                            economics that ignores environmental degradation invites social degradation -
                            in plain terms, violence.</p>
                        <p>It is no news that access to water is likely to be a major cause of
                            serious conflict in the century just beginning. But this is only one aspect
                            of a steadily darkening situation. Needless to say, it will be the poorest
                            countries that suffer first and most dramatically, but the
                            &quot;developed&quot; world will not be able to escape: the failure to manage
                            the resources we have, has the same consequences wherever we are. In the
                            interim, we can imagine &quot;fortress&quot; strategies (with increasing
                            levels of social control demanded) struggling to keep the growing instability
                            and violence elsewhere at bay and so intensifying its energy.</p>
                        <p>And we are not talking about a remote future. There are arguments over the
                            exact rates of global warming, certainly, and we cannot easily predict the
                            full effects of some modifications in species balance. But we should not
                            imagine that uncertainty in this or that particular seriously modifies the
                            overall picture. On any account, we are failing.</p>
                        <p>It is relatively easy to sketch the gravity of our situation; not too
                            difficult either to say that governments should be doing more. But
                            governments depend on electorates; electors are persons like us who need
                            motivating. Unless there is real popular motivation, governments are much
                            less likely to act or act effectively. There are always quite a few excuses
                            around for not taking action, and, without a genuine popular mandate for
                            change, we cannot be surprised or outraged if courage fails and progress is
                            minimal. Our own responsibility is to help change that popular motivation and
                            so to give courage to political leaders. And this means challenging and
                            changing some of the governing assumptions about ourselves as human
                            beings.</p>
                        <p>One of the reasons sometimes given for not being too alarmed by
                            predictions of ecological disaster is that we are underrating the
                            possibilities that will be offered by new technologies. But to appeal to a
                            technical future is to say that our most fundamental right as humans is
                            unrestricted consumer choice. In order to defend that, we must mobilise all
                            our resources of skill and ingenuity, diverting resources from other areas so
                            that we can solve problems created by our own addictive behaviours. The
                            question is whether, even if this were clearly possible, it would be a sane
                            or desirable way of envisaging the human future.</p>
                        <p>All the great religious traditions, in their several ways, insist that
                            personal wealth is not to be seen in terms of reducing the world to what the
                            individual can control and manipulate for whatever exclusively human purposes
                            may be most pressing. Religious belief claims, in the first place, that I am
                            most fully myself only in relation with my creator; what I am in virtue of
                            this relationship cannot be diminished or modified by any earthly power. In
                            the environment there is a dimension that resists and escapes us: to reduce
                            the world to a storehouse of materials for limited human purposes is thus to
                            put in question any serious belief in an indestructible human value.</p>
                        <p>We have to return constantly to what sort of structures and sanctions
                            might assist in making effective a change in our motivations and myths. We
                            could imagine, for instance, a &quot;charter&quot; of rights in relation to
                            the environment - that we should be able to live in a world that still had
                            wilderness spaces, that still nurtured a balanced variety of species, that
                            allowed us access to unpoisoned natural foodstuffs. It may be that the time
                            is ripe for an attempt at a comprehensive statement of this, a new UN
                            commitment - a &quot;Charter of Rights to Natural Capital&quot; to which
                            governments could sign up and by which their own practice and that of the
                            nations in whose economies they invested could be measured.</p>
                        <p>A manageable first step relating particularly to carbon emissions,
                            supported by a wide coalition of concerned parties, is of course the
                            &quot;contraction and convergence&quot; proposals initially developed by the
                            Global Commons Institute in London. This involves granting to each nation a
                            notional &quot;entitlement to pollute&quot; up to an agreed level that is
                            credibly compatible with overall goals for managing and limiting atmospheric
                            pollution. Those nations which exceed this level would have to pay pro rata
                            charges on their excess emissions. The money thus raised would be put at the
                            service of low-emission nations - or could presumably be ploughed back into
                            poor but high-emission nations - who would be, so to speak, in credit as to
                            their entitlements, so as to assist them in ecologically sustainable
                            development.</p>
                        <p>Election campaigns seldom give much space to environmental matters;
                            governments need strengthening in their commitments and need electoral
                            incentives to be involved in the sort of internationally agreed aspirations
                            But it is because the ecological agenda is always going to be vulnerable to
                            the pressure of other more apparently &quot;immediate&quot; issues that it
                            cannot be left to electoral politics alone. We still need a steady background
                            of awareness and small-scale committed action, nourished by some kind of
                            coherent vision.</p>
                        <p>Ecologists have argued regularly that some religious attitudes are part of
                            the problem; once again we have to ask whether religion is part of the
                            solution. Religious faith should steer us away from any fantasies we may have
                            of not &quot;interfering&quot; with the environment (the first planting of
                            grain was an interference), but it tells us that our interaction with what
                            lies around can never be simply functional and problem-solving.</p>
                        <p>Religious commitment becomes in this context a crucial element in that
                            renewal of our motivation for living realistically in our material setting.
                            The loss of a sustainable environment protected from unlimited exploitation
                            is the loss of a sustainable humanity in every sense - not only the loss of a
                            spiritual depth but ultimately the loss of simple material stability as well.
                            It is up to us as consumers and voters to do better justice to the
                            &quot;house&quot; we have been invited to keep, the world where we are
                            guests.</p>

                        <p>In 1929 this led to millions of men taking to the road. The difference today is that many

                        <p>So please, dear Archbishop, do not suggest new charters and agreements. Your letter published
                            before the UK elections expressed the problems very well.</p>
                        <p>It will all change. Your church and others will offer shelter and comfort in the coming
                            storm.</p>
                        <p>Please work with the people, not the establishment!</p>
                        <p>You write better than me, but this goes deeper than presentation, doesn&#8217;t it!</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable
                    civilization, a global interfaith movement has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
