                        <p>Dear Friends of the United Religions Initiative,</p>
                        <p>I refuse to live in an &ldquo;Age of Terror&rdquo;, though many
                            politically powerful people and extremists, bent on destruction and death,
                            see our time through that lens.</p>
                        <p>I choose, along with URI members and countless other sisters and brothers
                            around the world, to live in an &ldquo;Age of
                            Transformation&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>This age of transformation is no more risk free than an age of terror, but
                            it is an age of active hope rather than disabling fear. An age of cooperation
                            rather than domination. An age for healing ancient and modern wounds rather
                            than perpetuating an endless, escalating cycle of wounding. An age not for
                            promoting violence but for creating peace.</p>
                        <p>Those who believe that this is an age of transformation, and URI members
                            are among their ranks, choose to risk reaching out to those we do not know to
                            create cultures of peace, justice and healing. We choose to value, indeed
                            celebrate our diverse national, religious and cultural identities, while
                            claiming a unifying identity as citizens of this Earth and children of one
                            sacred source of all life.</p>
                        <p>So, without denying the violence of all kinds perpetrated within and by
                            all nations, often motivated by religious division, we choose to focus
                            instead on the flowering of human goodness and cooperation that creates the
                            possibility for a new and hopeful future for humanity.</p>
                        <p>A small, but stunning example of this movement occurred on 7 April 2005
                            when bus service connecting the Indian and Pakistani sides of Kashmir resumed
                            for the first time in over 50 years. China View reported:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>An emotional Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said he was proud of
                                the hundreds of people who had made the bus service possible so that
                                families divided for more than fifty years could come together.
                                &quot;Brothers and sisters will hold hands again, parents will meet
                                children,&quot; he said and talked of his dream of a beautiful Kashmir
                                where there was once again only joy and song.</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>The Times of India described the journey this way:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Like the peace process itself, passengers face a difficult and dangerous
                                ride. The 170-km dusty highway from Muzaffarabad to Srinagar clings to the
                                steep, forested Pir Panjal mountains, perilously close to an often straight
                                drop thousands of feet to the surging Jhelum.</p>
                            <p>The road is swept daily for mines. In places, it is single lane and the
                                wheels of the 19-seater buses come within inches of a sheer drop. Each of
                                India&#39;s buses bears the ancient Kashmiri couplet: &quot;I broke the
                                sword and made sickles out of it&quot;.</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>A final word should go to Farooq Ahmed Lone, a 25-year-old student in Uri,
                            the last main town before the border on the Indian side. He commented,
                            &ldquo;If this kind of thing continues, then maybe we will get to the point
                            where we will get rid of the militancy and there will be a better
                            life.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>URI is committed to daily engagement in the work of interfaith cooperation
                            to make real the better life that Farooq Ahmed Lone and billions of other
                            people on this Earth yearn for. We had hoped to have our own peace pilgrimage
                            of URI members from India to Pakistan in early April, but it proved
                            impossible to obtain the necessary visas. Still, a Pakistani interfaith peace
                            conference with honored guests from other countries was convened in Lahore,
                            and URI remains committed to work for the day when this India to Pakistan
                            peace pilgrimage will take place, as one of countless URI actions for peace,
                            justice and healing around the world.</p>
                        <p>This commitment and hundreds like it will be carried out by our
                            Cooperation Circles on five continents and supported by the members of
                            URI&rsquo;s outgoing Global Council and incoming Global Council, officially
                            selected on 6 April 2005. News of the new GC can be found on our website
                            <a href="http://www.uri.org/">www.uri.org</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>It is inconceivable to me that in these early years of the 21<sup>st</sup>
                            century when there is such a flowering of human cooperation around the world,
                            we would let our time be defined by &ldquo;terror&rdquo;. &nbsp;URI chooses a
                            different way. We can all choose a different way.</p>
                        <p>In this spirit, I extend greetings of love and peace to you and to all our
                            sisters and brothers around the world. And I invite you to join the global
                            movement to create an age of transformation.</p>
                        <p>Love,
                            The Rev. Canon Charles P. Gibbs</p>

                        <p>I stand with you as an Interfaith Minister and totally believe in this age of Transfromation.
                            We each must look for what is breaking through instead of looking at the many things in this
                            physical world that are breaking down. It is critical that many of us continue to hold a
                            High Vision, and express it in our life on this beautiful Blue Planet.There are many Loving
                            Progressive caring people that choose to live in harmony. We must remember, it is a call to
                            action and comming togerther in communitys of Harmony and cooperation for the many diverse
                            Religions and remember there is One God, One Spirit and many Paths to God. </p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable
                    civilization, a global interfaith movement has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
