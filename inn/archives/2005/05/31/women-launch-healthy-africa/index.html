                        <p>Many initiatives were born or carried farther forward at the Second
                            Inter-Faith Action for Peace in Africa Summit, which took place in
                            Johannesburg, South Africa, in late April. Personally, I found the story of
                            the &quot;Mother&#39;s Cry for a Healthy Africa&quot; the most compelling
                            of these &mdash; calling for African women to &quot;unite against
                            war.&quot; Please read on for the full story; broader coverage of the event

                        <p><i>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa/GENEVA, 23 April 2005 (LWI)</i> &ndash;Women
                            participants in an inter-faith summit near Johannesburg, sent a powerful
                            message of reconciliation and reconstruction in the launch of a symbolic
                            &ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s Cry for a Healthy Africa.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>The &ldquo;mother&rsquo;s cry&rdquo; presented in a dramatic display of
                            poetry, recitation of holy writings and dance on April 22 marked the
                            beginning of an inter-faith campaign that seeks to support programs targeted
                            at healing and counseling of post-war victims. The campaign was based on the
                            outcome of a &ldquo;Mothers and Daughters Pre-summit,&rdquo; attended by over
                            100 women drawn from all over Africa, April 18-20.</p>
                        <p>The launch in the context of the Second Inter-Faith Action for Peace in
                            Africa (IFAPA) Summit taking place April 21-25, began with a colorful
                            procession by the women. They carried placards expressing some of the
                            challenges that they face including &ldquo;AIDS,&rdquo;
                            &ldquo;Conflict,&rdquo; &ldquo;FGM [female genital mutilation],&rdquo;
                            &ldquo;Poverty&rdquo; and &ldquo;Violence.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;African women should unite against war&hellip;. Everybody has to be
                            concerned because peace is for the common good,&rdquo; an emotional Ms Dandi
                            Lou Amanan pleaded shortly after women and men participants sang, &ldquo;We
                            shall overcome.&rdquo; Amanan is a former social worker with the United
                            Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in conflicted-affected areas and
                            founder of Vision and Action of African Women Against Wars in Ivory
                            Coast.</p>
                        <p>In their statement of solidarity, the women leaders acknowledged that men
                            and women alike have been perpetrators and victims of violent conflicts and
                            wars in Africa. Such conflicts, they regretted, had destroyed the spiritual,
                            economic, social and political well being of Africa.</p>
                        <p>Their statement included an affirmation that women are the cornerstone of
                            social harmonization and the integration of African societies, and thus could
                            not be excluded from issues that deal with peace and security. They noted
                            that the intervention of inter-faith women in peace building would introduce
                            a dimension that would help lead to comprehensive and sustainable peace in
                            Africa.</p>
                        <p>They further undertook to launch an African women&rsquo;s inter-faith
                            network, appoint regional or country liaison persons between local
                            communities and IFAPA as well as establish an Internet-based forum through
                            which they could share their different experiences.</p>
                        <p>Joining the women in the &ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s Cry for a Healthy
                            Africa&rdquo; inter-faith campaign was Dr Brigalia Bam, chairperson of the
                            Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) of South Africa. Addressing the IFAPA
                            summit earlier on, Bam encouraged women to use women&rsquo;s movements to
                            influence decision-making about key issues that touch on their well being and
                            that of the entire society.</p>
                        <p>The Second IFAPA summit brings together over 240 participants from all
                            over Africa, as well as observers from Europe and North America. There are
                            eight faith communities represented at the summit namely, African Traditional
                            Religion, Baha&rsquo;i, Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and
                            Rastafarian. The theme of the summit is &ldquo;Working Together for Peace in
                            Africa.&rdquo; The event is coordinated by the Lutheran World Federation and
                            hosted by the National Religious Leaders Forum of South Africa.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable
                    civilization, a global interfaith movement has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
