                        <p>Bishop William E. Swing of California has written the following
                            reflection to honor Roman Catholic Archbishop William J. Levada of San
                            Francisco, who on Friday, May 13, was named prefect of the Vatican&#39;s
                            Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p class="author">By The Rt. Rev. William E. Swing</p>
                    <p class="postdate">May 18, 2005</p>
                    <div class="entry">
                        <p><a id="more-65"></a>
                        <p><em>Distributed by the Episcopal News Service (ENS)</em></p>
                        <p>When Pope Benedict XVI named Archbishop William J. Levada to lead the
                            Vatican&#39;s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, there was much
                            rejoicing in San Francisco. Certainly among his Roman Catholic flock, but
                            also among Jews, Muslims, Protestants, and a host of others. Archbishop
                            Levada has a generous and hospitable heart toward people of varying faiths.
                            Therefore, so many of us feel as though a friend is headed toward Rome.</p>
                        <p>When he was chosen to be the co-chair, along with our Presiding Bishop, of
                            ARCIC (Anglican-Roman Catholic Interfaith Consultation), the first thing he
                            did was to come to Grace Cathedral and ask to see a Book of Common Prayer.
                            From there Archbishop Levada studied our Anglican ethos and even attended the
                            2003 General Convention in Minneapolis. He sat in on the debates of both
                            Houses surrounding consents for the Bishop of New Hampshire.</p>
                        <p>When the Episcopal Charities of the Diocese of California had its annual
                            banquet in 1998, we chose to honor Archbishop Levada and the Catholic
                            Charities, which at the time was celebrating 90 years of service. His concern
                            for the poor and marginalized is well recognized in the Bay Area. The
                            Episcopal Charities and the Catholic Charities have become colleagues, and
                            now we complement rather than compete.</p>
                        <p>One of the upcoming occasions of farewell for the Archbishop will be
                            hosted by interfaith leaders. Archbishop Levada reached out specifically to
                            the Jewish and Muslim communities. His ecumenical officer was a pioneer board
                            member of the United Religions Initiative. And on many local and national
                            social issues his leadership rallied religious leaders to take a stand. Each
                            year he also hosts an ecumenical or an interfaith luncheon at St. Mary&#39;s
                            Cathedral, San Francisco.</p>
                        <p>Personally I cherish the Madonna and Child which he brought to our home
                            when we dined with our dear friend Anthony, Greek Orthodox Metropolitan. On
                            that evening we decided to go together to see the Pope, the Ecumenical
                            Patriarch, and the Archbishop of Canterbury. We left in April 2003. A
                            memorable and deeply moving ecumenical pilgrimage. Pope John Paul II had one
                            audience for us and one for our entourage. His All Holiness, Bartholomew,
                            hosted us for two days in Istanbul. We were unable to get on the calendar of
                            the Archbishop of Canterbury, but the Bishop of London and the dean of
                            Canterbury Cathedral were marvelously welcoming. All of us came away with a
                            far deeper appreciation of each other&#39;s tradition and genuine affection
                            for each other.</p>
                        <p>By the way, the Archbishop and I were born in the same summer, both named
                            William, graduated from schools in the same years, were ordained to the
                            priesthood on the same day, consecrated bishops around the same time, and
                            served in San Francisco. Now when most bishops my age have retired, here is
                            Levada starting anew in one of the most important religious positions in the
                            world.</p>
                        <p>I truly admire him. His heart toward God. Outstanding scholar. Devotion to
                            the Church. A rich capacity for friendship. Candor, strength, integrity, and
                            grace. With the guidance of the Holy Spirit he will be faithful to Jesus
                            Christ and serve with courage and compassion.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable

                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
