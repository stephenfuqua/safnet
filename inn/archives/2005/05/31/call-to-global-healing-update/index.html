                        <p>For the occasion of World Environment Day (June 5th), I asked Dave
                            Randle to send an update on the status of the <a class="dead-link" title="This link is no longer available">Call
                                to Global Healing</a>. While
                            the Call is rooted in environmental consciousness, you will find that it
                            has moved well beyond and has led the Utah URI Cooperation Circle into the
                            heart of conflict in working to provide aid and support to people in
                            need.</p>

                    <p class="author">By Dr. David W. Randle</p>
                    <p class="postdate">May 2005</p>
                    <div class="entry">
                        <p>As many know the URI held its first ever Regional Summit in the Olympic
                            Village in Salt Lake City.?The event was an official program of the 2002 Salt
                            Lake Winter Olympic Games.</p>
                        <p>It was at this event that the vision for the Olympic Peace Pole project
                            was announced and the first Olympic Peace Pole dedicated as part of the URI
                            North American Summit.</p>
                        <p>The Olympic Peace Pole project grew to 168 special Olympic peace poles (2
                            for every nation at the Olympic Games). It was an exciting time during the
                            Salt Lake Winter Olympic Games as Bishop William Swing and Rev. Charles Gibbs
                            provided the initial training to create the Olympic Interfaith Committee and
                            the Utah URI CC worked with Deborah Moldow and Monica Willard of the U.N. CC
                            to bring the custom made peace poles to the 2002 Winter Olympic Games.</p>
                        <p>As positive receptivity came from the two interfaith services, and
                            dedication by the Mayor of Salt Lake of the Olympic poles at City Hall. Once
                            dedicated the poles were seen by thousands through events such as the Beach
                            Boys performing to thousands of people interspersed among the peace poles,
                            many cultural events, and watching the Olympic torch bearer run through the
                            peace pole path with the Olympic flame. Throughout the project an awareness
                            developed that URI had much to say to the world. It was clear through these
                            events that URI had a message to share regarding its purpose of daily
                            interfaith cooperation, ending religiously motivated violence, and creating
                            cultures of peace, justice and healing the Earth for all living beings.</p>
                        <p>So the question raised was how could this good spirit of the Olympic peace
                            pole project be taken to the first ever URI Global Assembly in Rio de
                            Janeiro.</p>
                        <p>The answer was to propose a Global Initiative titled the Call to Global
                            Healing. After several drafts from members of the Utah URI cc and the U.N.
                            URI cc as well as input from other URI members around the globe, and the U.N.
                            Environment Programme (UNEP), a document was completed to present to the
                            first ever URI Global Assembly.</p>
                        <p>In August 2002, with 400 plus participants from 37 countries and 50 faith
                            traditions in attendance the Call to Global Healing was endorsed unanimously
                            by the URI Global Assembly, commended by Adnan Amin the director of UNEP at
                            the U.N. Headquarters in NY, and sent to Johannesburg, South Africa as part
                            of the World Summit on Sustainable Development.</p>
                        <p>The following January Bishop William Swing, founder of the URI, Dr. Noel
                            Brown and Pierre Quiblier of UNEP, Dr. David Randle and other Utah URI
                            members, a representative of the U.N. URI, and others from interfaith,
                            environmental, business, and government organizations met in Snowbird, Utah
                            to develop an implementation plan for the Call to Global Healing.</p>
                        <p>Since then the WHALE Center (the 501(c) 3 organization that administers
                            Utah URI) has served as the administrative organization for the Global
                            Healing Initiative that has now been joined by over 35 affiliate
                            organizations, thousands of individuals, and businesses who make
                            contributions on its Store page.</p>
                        <p>Dr. David W. Randle and Dr. Noel Brown have served as facilitators for
                            this initiative as it continues to evolve.</p>
                        <p>Currently URI members have several ways to participate in the Call to
                            Global Healing. Some of these opportunities include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Learning about Global Healing. The main site includes a

                                healing and a link to the Call to Global Healing text.

                                interfaith cooperation. On the Global Healing mainsite people have the
                                opportunity to join the Care2 Global Healing discussion group that now
                                includes almost 400 people from 45 states and 30 nations who have daily
                                conversations re: Global Healing.</li>
                            <li>Global Healing Youth Page. A special site to provide resources and
                                organizational links for youth wanting to be involved in Global

                                opportunities on this site through cooperative URI projects in Malawi,
                                Uganda, and South Africa.</li>
                            <li>These are opportunities to promote daily interfaith cooperation and

                        <p>The <a href="http://www.globalhealing.net/store.html">Global Healing
                                Store</a> page was designed with several things in mind. Key features of this

                                way to keep informed on current issues in regions of the world one is
                                interested in.</li>
                            <li>Products and Services including unique stores such as The Wild Divine
                                which offers a biofeedback computer game with the goal of teaching
                                compassion, the Peace Company and the World Peace Prayer Society Gift shop

                                Coffee just rated #2 Corporation out of 1000 for being most socially

                            <li>Global Healing stores also offer commissions to pay for the
                                administrative costs for the Global Healing website. A percentage of the
                                Commissions also go to support URI Global and the URI Africa Development
                                fund. The idea is that if enough persons utilize the global healing store
                                for online shopping both better choices in products and services are made
                                and because administrative costs are paid for 100% of donations to service
                                projects such as the Southern Sudan Education project go to that project
                                and not to overhead or website fees.</li>
                            <li>The Opportunity to Donate to Global Healing is also on the site with
                                donations strengthening this program and its outreach.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Please visit the Global Healing site and find ways you can support global
                            healing as a way of participating in the implementation of the URI
                            purpose.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable
                    civilization, a global interfaith movement has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
