                    <div class="entry">
                        <h2>Designed for Diversity</h2>
                        <p>The Interfaith Center at the Presidio is developing a self-organizing
                            group of people representing the religious, cultural diversity of our world
                            who regularly gather to develop friendships, pray and reflect, celebrate
                            their differences, and explore the concerns they share.</p>
                        <p>By contrast, of course, most worshiping communities congregate around a
                            shared history and tradition, a set of beliefs and a special story, often
                            conveyed in holy scripture.</p>
                        <h2>Based on Caring Relationships</h2>
                        <p>What we are calling the Interfaith Center&#39;s <i>Family Circle</i> is
                            not an alternative but an adjunct to the church, temple, or mosque. The group
                            provides a sacred intersection, a time and place where people from all faiths
                            can share dialogue and spiritual practice. <i>Circle</i> activities promote
                            learning spiritually about ourselves and others in an open, safe,
                            &#39;non-partisan,&#39; appreciative environment.</p>
                        <p>As a gathering community we have no creed or statement of faith, leaving
                            that to each of us individually. Members and guests are invited to use the
                            community as a place to pursue their own convictions and questions with
                            similarly questing people from diverse backgrounds. There is an assumption
                            that participants respect and care about each other, joining in dialogue
                            without feeling compelled to agree about issues or change anyone&rsquo;s
                            mind. Hearing faith journeys is a staple of <i>Circle</i> activities.</p>
                        <p>The group seeks to be a non-judgmental community for the alienated to
                            heal, the weary to be rejuvenated, the satisfied to be challenged, and the
                            unaffiliated to frame their own journey. The group might also be a home to
                            the growing number of individuals who find that they are
                            &quot;spiritual&quot; but not necessarily &quot;religious&quot; and
                            appreciate the opportunity to join in community with kindred spirits. At the
                            same time, members and guests are encouraged to stay connected to their own
                            traditions, taking back home an appreciation of what can be learned in an
                            interfaith context.</p>
                        <h2>Grounded in Shared Values</h2>
                        <p>The Center&#39;s <i>Family Circle</i> is <i>not</i> a new religion, nor
                            does it try to identify or serve a lowest common spiritual denominator.
                            Instead the community offers a sacred meeting place where we can personally
                            and appreciatively explore the diversity we represent while working to
                            improve the world and the whole human family. We tend away from identifying
                            and focusing on convergences except ethically, as in the Golden Rule that
                            most traditions treasure. A few additional shared values and commitments set
                            the tone and context for the interfaith community:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mutual respect is the currency of the <i>Family Circle</i>.</li>
                            <li>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is affirmed as the necessary
                                groundwork for humankind&rsquo;s health and vitality.</li>
                            <li>Circle members commit themselves <i>to promote daily, enduring
                                    interfaith cooperation, to end religiously motivated violence, and to
                                    create cultures of peace, justice, and healing for the Earth and all living
                                    beings.</i> (From the Charter of the United Religions Initiative).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>Cultivating Interfaith Practice</h2>
                        <p>The group&rsquo;s activities, including shared worship, are typically
                            planned and led by people from several traditions. Each participant speaks
                            out of his or her own personal background in a context where all traditions
                            and individuals are respected and honored. We are open to all points of view,
                            theistic and atheistic, spiritual and material, rational and imaginative.</p>
                        <p>A worship and hospitality group plans services; typically they include
                            silence, meditation, and prayer; stories, readings, and reflections; and
                            music, including singing and chanting.</p>
                        <p>Self-organizing classes, support groups, projects, meditation and prayer
                            groups, and social events are expected to emerge.</p>
                        <p>A priority commitment among the <i>Circle&#39;s</i> founders is providing
                            educational opportunities that focus on the essence and &#39;best&#39; of the
                            different traditions we represent; on ways to generate dialogue and healthy
                            relations among and within these traditions; and on skills for cultivating
                            friendship and community-building among strangers.</p>
                        <h2>Worship &amp; Dialogue Guidelines</h2>
                        <p>Those who attend services are invited to participate, to simply observe,
                            or to leave and take some time out. Shared religious practice should
                            <i>never</i> be coerced.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Offer everyone the same respect and dignity you hope to receive.</li>
                            <li>Listen to the other person with enough care to begin to discern the
                                &quot;positive core,&quot; the life-giving energy, in his or her faith and
                                practice.</li>
                            <li>Speak from the heart, not to make a point but to build understanding
                                and relationship</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>Joining the <i>Interfaith Family</i></h2>
                        <p>SPONSOR &ndash; The <i>Family Circle</i> is one of many Interfaith Center
                            at the Presidio projects. The Interfaith Center is an umbrella organization
                            of 20 Bay Area interfaith sponsoring organizations. The Center cares for and
                            manages the Main Post Chapel in the Presidio, where the <i>Circle</i> holds
                            its activities.</p>
                        <p>FOUNDERS &ndash; The <i>Family Circle</i> was created by interfaith
                            activists connected to the Center who seek a spiritual connection with this
                            interreligious community on a regular basis, a sacred sense of time and space
                            shared with brothers and sisters from different backgrounds. The group also
                            hopes to welcome the unaffiliated, offering a supportive way-station rather
                            than a particular map for their spiritual journey.</p>
                        <p>Because the founders do not want to create a new religion, the group
                            develops its own mission and outreach activities around the multiple programs
                            the Interfaith Center sponsors with ecumenical and interfaith groups. The
                            Family will raise funds and generate programs, not as a congregation, but as
                            part of and in support of Interfaith Center activities.</p>
                        <p>PARTICIPANTS &ndash; The group welcomes to worship and table any visitor
                            who comes with good-will and respect.</p>
                        <p>The group welcomes into <i>membership</i> good-willed people who affirm
                            the values and mission of the Center.</p>
                        <p>Members understand that the <i>Circle</i> has no creed or faith of its
                            own, has no hierarchy, is not a church or temple or mosque, but instead a
                            regular gathering place for people of faith and practice everywhere.</p>
                        <p>A NEW MODEL &ndash; The hope is that the <i>Family Circle</i> becomes a
                            new kind of model for generating and supporting interfaith relations in any
                            local community. The group&#39;s founders have no interest in becoming
                            another national organization or alternative denomination. But they would be
                            delighted if similar circles developed support for existing or nascent
                            interfaith activities in their own communities. Following this model means
                            identifying and supporting the existing interfaith groups in your own
                            neighborhood.</p>
                        <p>The Interfaith Center&#39;s <i>Family Circle</i> model identifies and
                            engages individuals who passionately agree with the Catholic theologian Hans
                            K&uuml;ng when he said, &quot;There will be no peace among nations until
                            there is peace among religions, and there will be no peace among religions
                            until there is dialogue among religions.&quot; The <i>Circle</i> seeks to
                            provide ongoing, dynamic intersections where different traditions can be in
                            regular dialogue with each other, and where the religiously alienated,
                            unaffiliated, and uneducated can find a friendly home and a safe place to
                            grow.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, the <i>Circle&#39;s</i> founders want to provide an ongoing
                            opportunity for people who passionately care about interfaith relations to
                            become serious donors and volunteers making a difference starting in their
                            own communities.</p>

                        <p>Dear Friend of Interfaith Development,</p>
                        <p>I began Interfaith Center here in this heart land in 1996 and continue to connect, dialogue
                            and share with many religions and Spiritual Paths.</p>
                        <p>I stand with you as an Interfaith Minister and totally believe in this age of Transfromation.
                            We each must look for what is breaking through instead of looking at the many things in this
                            physical world that are breaking down. It is critical that many of us continue to hold a
                            High Vision, and express it in our life on this beautiful Blue Planet.There are many Loving
                            Progressive caring people that choose to live in harmony.
                            We must remember, it is a call to action and coming togerther in communitys of Harmony and
                            cooperation for the many diverse Religions and remember there is One God, One Spirit and
                            many Paths to God. </p>
                        <p>With Peace and Joyous Blessings,</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable
                    civilization, a global interfaith movement has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
