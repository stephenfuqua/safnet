                    <p class="author">By Rev. Al Bloom, January 2005</p>
                    <p class="postdate">March 30th, 2005 by sfuqua </p>
                    <div class="lead">
                        <p>Rev. Al Bloom of Hawai&#39;i writes of the duty of all religious believers
                            to express the social, affirming implications of their religious beliefs when
                            engaged in social discourse, as well as the need to understand the meaning
                            and fact of &quot;separation of church and state.&quot;</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="entry">
                        <p> <a id="more-28"></a>
                        <p>The role of religious faith and politics is one of the pressing issues of
                            our day. How are we to express our faith freely in the arena of public debate
                            and choice? Religious faith is an important facet of personal identity,
                            defining who we are. It is, therefore, inevitable and appropriate that
                            religious faith and values influence our social views and participation.</p>
                        <p>However, we live in a religiously pluralistic, multicultural, democratic
                            and free society. All of us have the right to be who we are and to speak out
                            for what we believe. Living in such a complex society places a responsibility
                            on all of us to bring our views to the table in an informative and respectful
                            manner.</p>
                        <p>There are sharp differences of opinion on numerous social issues that have
                            a religious foundation, such as abortion, stem cell research, gay rights,
                            women&#39;s rights, capital punishment, war, and separation of church and
                            state. In the context of free discussion, each person can advocate one&#39;s
                            view.</p>
                        <p>The assumption in any democratic process is that all participants work to
                            achieve the common good, which includes life, liberty and the pursuit of
                            happiness for all. Consequently, it is the responsibility of advocates to
                            demonstrate how their views are conducive to the public welfare. An advocate
                            must show that, regardless of one&#39;s sacred scriptures and personal
                            beliefs, each individual&#39;s views contribute to the social good for
                            all.</p>
                        <p>The importance of the principle of separation of church and state is not
                            merely the issue of the intrusion of one institution into the sphere of
                            another. It means that no person or institution can coerce a citizen&#39;s
                            conscience or limit personal choices that do not undermine or injure society
                            simply by politically legislating behavior based on religious belief, even if
                            it is the majority belief. There must be a compelling reason to prohibit a
                            behavior. Secular societies prohibit murder, not because it is part of a
                            divine moral code, but because such acts create disorder and violate a
                            society&#39;s peace and security.</p>
                        <p>There are, therefore, two principles that must be observed as we involve
                            religious faith in social decisions. One is to demonstrate contribution of a
                            belief in the social good that also affirms respect for all people. The
                            second is to understand that the separation of church and state strictly
                            prevents religious bodies from using the power of the state to legislate and
                            enforce their beliefs in a manner that denies democratic process and the
                            diversity of a free society. Courts are necessary to clarify the
                            boundaries.</p>
                        <p>Religious discussions can be maintained and spiritual values recognized
                            through a commitment to human dignity and adherence to the democratic
                            process. The best minds on all sides can work mutually for the common good,
                            motivated by their spiritual traditions, while maintaining diversity.
                            Dialogue means to &quot;talk it through.&quot; We can have discussion rather
                            than argument and differences in the context of commonality. The spiritual
                            health of the community and the vitality of religious faith will be
                            strengthened for all.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable
                    civilization, a global interfaith movement has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
