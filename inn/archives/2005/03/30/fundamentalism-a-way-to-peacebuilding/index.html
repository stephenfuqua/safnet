                    <div class="entry">
                        <p>The Middle East conflict is perhaps the most cited conflict as a clear
                            example of the negative role religion might play in complicating an already
                            inflamed political crisis. What prevented political solutions, as those
                            conducted in Oslo and Camp David II, from achieving their goals was simply,
                            it is claimed, the mutual religious fundamentalism. How can you make peace
                            with a nation, which your holy book asserts you will fight? How can you
                            convince someone who is committing suicide that peace is good because it
                            gives him better education and a better job? Besides, how can you divide a
                            piece of land between two peoples when each people&#39;s holy
                            book grants the entire land to the holder of this book?</p>
                        <p>Admitting the significance of religion, particularly in its ability to
                            make peace fail, it was advised that peacebuilders must refer to religion in
                            speeches, writings and activism. It was also thought that once the
                            &quot;religious leaders&quot; instruct their
                            corresponding followers of making peace the followers will automatically
                            shift to a peace agenda. The two pieces of advice were observed but
                            unfortunately the results were disappointing. In Islam the religious
                            leaders&#39; liberal arguments that Ben Laden has no right to
                            interpret Koran, his ideology is wrong and Islam
                            &quot;naturally&quot; calls to peace have
                            fallen on deaf ears.</p>
                        <p>What went wrong was that depriving Ben Laden from his right to read and
                            interpret the text is simply self-contradictory with a liberal discourse.
                            Second, the emphasis on the need of a new liberal reading to advocate peace
                            sounds conspiratory to mainstream Arab Muslims as it puts the result of the
                            fatwa before conducting its very process. Third, what legitimizes a religious
                            discourse and makes it theologically authentic is not the results it reaches,
                            but rather the strict methodology it follows to reach those results. In other
                            words, it is not the question, of what but that of how, which matters.</p>
                        <p>Fundamentalism is a migrating concept that has held different meanings in
                            different milieus. In the Islamic theological sphere the meaning it carries
                            is one of orthodoxy; the going back to the two Islamic fundamentals, Koran
                            and Sunna, in encountering the contemporary events and problems. As such its
                            meaning is desirable and respected, leaving behind a very negative sense of
                            heresy and schism to whatever becomes its opponent. The Islamic discourse
                            that calls for using violence has legitimized itself by sticking to
                            fundamentalism, in methodological terms. On the other hand, those Islamic
                            discourses that call for peace have unfortunately used both liberal rhetoric
                            that pleases Western media and politicians, and ethical preaching that
                            convinces no one.</p>
                        <p>To encounter the violence-discourse one must first critique it both
                            conceptually and methodologically. We have to isolate the corner-stones
                            concepts of this discourse and then pay them a serious and patient analysis
                            using the traditional methodology Muslim scholars have built up and observed
                            for long centuries. We must also examine the structure of the discourse and
                            the consistency of its arguments; how concepts, pieces of texts and old
                            writings are weaved together to make up, and rationalize, an independent body
                            of knowledge with a specific political agenda.</p>
                        <p>There is a long list of conflict-making concepts such as Jihad, Martyrdom,
                            The Jews, Holy Land, Islamic State, the Prophecy&hellip; . In
                            their new context Jihad would mean an eternal war against non-Muslims;
                            martyrdom will be used to legitimize suicide operations against civilians;
                            the Jews will reflect a pan-historical transcendental mass of people, which
                            is destined to a hostile attitude against Muslims; and the Holy Land will
                            grant a sacred nature to a piece of land with the creation of new specific
                            political regulations and considerations while approaching it. The Islamic
                            State will turn into an integral part of religion, a necessary political
                            system that is essential to the practice of Islam, and which overcasts the
                            political relations and the land and people it ever ruled with a set of
                            must-observed regulations. The whole discourse is led by a prophecy, a view
                            of the future, and it is not a future of peace. It is a future of war between
                            Muslims and Jews in the Holy Land that will mark the end of this world. How
                            could nice rhetoric like &quot;Islam and Salam have the same
                            linguistic root&quot; swiftly shift these giant obstacles?</p>
                        <p>Far from being in need to quit the traditional methodology, or to reject
                            the ancient works and writings, we have rather to work them out. By using
                            such a fundamentalist critique, and ultimately founding a new encountering
                            discourse we will achieve two main goals. First, we will show up the
                            inconsistency and the major, sometimes fatal, mistakes the violence-discourse
                            is committing from a traditional point of view. Second, embarking on the rich
                            and diverse Islamic works, which have been carved out through different and
                            quite contradictory historical contexts, we will prove that the known
                            fundamentalist discourse is not the only possible one of its kind. An
                            authentic traditionalist discourse, which yet maintains a peaceful political
                            agenda, is also possible.</p>
                        <p>Would that automatically solve the Middle East conflict? Certainly not!
                            The conflict has so many elements that the religious element is only one of
                            them. That however will help solve the problem by neutralizing its
                            inflammable religious element. Most religious people, I believe, want
                            peace. For them, the economic promises are not enough and the ethical
                            preaching is almost meaningless. They need and long for an outlet, a
                            legitimized authentic outlet. This approach aims to offer them what I think
                            is the only one possible for them!</p>

                        <p>We seem to be forgetting a key element of the fundamentalism, that is ignorance or more
                            precisely wrong knowledge. Here is an example from my book <a
                                href="http://www.chickenstand.ca/" rel="nofollow">www.chickenstand.ca</a>
                            I was always offended by “blind faith,” and I still am. I recall visiting Pakistan in the
                            late 1990s, during the month of Ramadan, the holiest period of the calendar for Muslims. The
                            last Friday of that month is the most sacred day, and it is said that anyone who prays that
                            day will be blessed, as God will grant what they ask for.</p>
                        <p> On that holy day, I was traveling from Lahore to another city by car, accompanied by some
                            Pakistani businessmen. As we passed through a town, we heard the call to prayer. There was a
                            mosque by the roadside, and it was overflowing with people. Young children were milling
                            about everywhere. We stopped the car and got out, and heard the imam preaching the sermon of
                            the Noon Prayer. Mats were spread outside the mosque, and right unto the road, because of
                            the huge overflow of people. We sat down on the mats and listened to the sermon.</p>
                        <p> My blood started to boil, as I heard what the imam was telling the multitude. My heart
                            started to beat faster and faster, and my face was clearly turning a bright shade of red,
                            because the others I was with kept staring at me. “Why are you so upset?” one asked me. “You
                            are saying a prayer to God, Zia, and not to that imam! Ignore what he is saying!”</p>
                        <p> But I could not. I remember all too well what the foolish religious leader was declaiming to
                            his flock. “This is the holiest day of the year, so you should pray to Allah,” he exclaimed.
                            “If you are sincere in your heart, I promise you that a miracle will happen! Pray all night,
                            making sure that you place a glass of water beside you! And in the morning, your prayers
                            will be answered, as your water will have turned into milk!”</p>
                        <p> Was this in the holy Koran? I doubted it. But I was filled with anger, regardless. These are
                            innocent people, in a backward town, in a Third World Country! And he was telling them that
                            by praying, water would be turned into milk! </p>
                        <p> He said something else which made me even angrier, and I could not forgive him for it. There
                            were all these gullible children there, many of them soaking in every stupid word! The imam
                            exclaimed, “Because this week is the holiest week of the year, it is the responsibility of
                            every angel on this earth to throw stones at Satan, who is up there, in the sky! So, at
                            night, when you see streaks of light across the sky, know thee that the angels are throwing
                            stones at Satan up there!”</p>
                        <p>Muslims have to look at ways to demolish myths, wrong knowledge and ignorance.

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable
                    civilization, a global interfaith movement has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
