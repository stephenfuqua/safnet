                    <div class="lead">
                        <p>While most pundits blame <em>Islamic fundamentalism</em> (or Jewish, or
                            Christian, etc.) for violence in the name of religion, Turkish author Harun
                            Yahya believes it is rather <em>radicalism</em> that drives the
                            supposedly-religious to violence. To achieve a mutual peace will require
                            sustained efforts at educating all believers about the truths in other
                            religions and downplaying <em>radical</em> ideologies.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p class="author">By Harun Yahya</p>
                    <div class="entry">
                        <p>Radical tendencies, irrespective of their origin, are one of the most
                            dangerous threats to world peace and security. Radicalism means to advocate
                            fundamental and sudden changes by means of uncompromising and hard-line
                            policies. In an environment where mutual acceptance and understanding have
                            ceased to exist, people begin to feel animosity toward different ideologies
                            or races without knowing what the other party really represents or
                            believes.</p>
                        <p>In our own time, radicalism has emerged among Muslims, Christians, and
                            Jews. This situation is abused and taken advantage of by proponents of Samuel
                            Huntington&#39;s proposed clash of civilizations theory. The scale of
                            radicalism&#39;s threat to world peace has become apparent in the 9/11
                            attacks on the United States and its consequences. The fact that these
                            attacks are widely believed to have been carried out in the name of Islam
                            resulted in a great deal of prejudice against Muslims and misunderstanding of
                            Islam. Given the fact that Islam prohibits all acts of violence and
                            aggression, most of the Islamic world condemned these terrorist attacks.
                            Muslims prayed alongside Christians for the innocent lives lost, and American
                            Muslims rushed to the aid of the victims. Despite this, prejudice against
                            Muslims in the United States and some European countries has vastly
                            increased, and incidences of violence have been reported. In order to
                            eradicate radicalism and its damaging consequences, cultural and educational
                            campaigns designed to reach all sections of society must be organized. We can
                            list the topics and the responsibilities of various sections of society to be
                            covered by this program, as follows:</p>
                        <p>An awareness that radicalism, an extremist tendency that is incompatible
                            with true religious morality, must be defeated ideologically so that its
                            claim to be acting in the name of religion can be exposed as false. People of
                            all three divinely revealed religions must be told that they have a
                            responsibility to be compassionate, patient, gentle, friendly, polite, and
                            respectful. They have to be made aware that God forbids violence, aggression,
                            and anything that harms innocent people. They must understand that it is
                            wrong to go down that path. These efforts will ensure that all radicals will
                            be recognized as misguided liars and thereby prevented from finding new
                            recruits.</p>
                        <p>A program must be designed to give full and accurate information about all
                            parties involved in the conflict, so that international dialogue becomes
                            possible. An important step toward mutually friendly relations is the
                            creation of an environment in which Jews, Christians, and Muslims can begin
                            to know each other&#39;s beliefs, traditions, and rituals better. This can be
                            done through cultural and educational programs. As people come to know each
                            other better, they will realize that they have many things in common. This,
                            in turn, will make reconciliation possible. Muslims, Christians, and Jews
                            should tell one another about their respective worldviews in line with
                            God&#39;s divine books of revelation, thereby preventing the mutual
                            misunderstanding and radicalism caused by a lack of accurate knowledge.</p>
                        <p>The media must support the cultural activities necessary to create an
                            environment conducive to international dialogue. They should refrain from
                            sensationalism, which incites violence and segregation, and focus on
                            broadcasts that encourage moderation and acceptance. Carefully prepared
                            broadcasts by the western media will play an important role in eradicating
                            the currently widespread anti-Muslim prejudice. Muslim media organizations,
                            for their part, must refrain from broadcasts and opinions that incite hatred
                            toward non-Muslims and concentrate instead on cultural and spiritual
                            education in the Islamic world.</p>
                        <p>Jewish, Christian, and Muslim religious leaders and opinion makers must
                            identify people who are bent on portraying myths and false beliefs as part of
                            the religious code. They must teach people that God commands believers to be
                            balanced and gentle, and that all extremism is contrary to religious
                            morality. Political leaders must support this awareness campaign in order to
                            prevent extremism in society and to prepare the ground for moderation.</p>
                        <p>These and similar joint efforts will eradicate the conditions conducive to
                            radicalism. In Qur&#39;an 2:113, God reveals that the Jews claimed that the
                            Christians &quot;have nothing to stand on&quot; and vice versa. In reality,
                            God knows best who is right, which is why genuine believers must seek to draw
                            closer to God instead of accusing one another. The following verse reveals
                            that people who act otherwise are wrong:</p>
                        <p>The Jews say: &quot;The Christians have nothing to stand on,&quot; and the
                            Christians say: &quot;The Jews have nothing to stand on,&quot; yet they both
                            recite the Book. Those who do not know say the same as they say. God will
                            judge between them on the Day of Resurrection regarding the things about
                            which they differ. (Qur&#39;an, 2:113)</p>
                        <p>Eradicating the harm caused by Jewish, Christian, and Muslim radicals is
                            possible only if all moderate, peace-loving, civilized, and genuinely
                            religious people cooperate and form an alliance. Such an alliance will defeat
                            those who present war and conflict as the only option, and disprove the
                            assertions of those who advocate a show of force as the only way to achieve
                            security and prevent further bloodshed, tears, and material damage.</p>
                        <h3>Qur&#39;anic Morality Forbids Extremism</h3>
                        <p>Islamic societies have been centers of mutual acceptance and goodwill
                            toward non-Muslims throughout history, particularly in our Prophet&#39;s (may
                            God bless him and grant him peace) time.</p>
                        <p>Radicalism is an ideological movement and political approach that is
                            foreign to Islam. When radical groups are examined, it gradually becomes
                            clear that they are, in reality, using a compilation of communist slogans and
                            methods or that they have adopted the &quot;fanatical rage of the Time of
                            Ignorance&quot; (Qur&#39;an, 48:26). One of the common characteristics of
                            such ideologies is their emotional force, an underlying cause of radicalism
                            that is totally incompatible with God&#39;s commands. The Qur&#39;an
                            describes Muslims as people who control their anger and who are reasonable,
                            moderate, and tolerant. Muslims must be polite and respectful when
                            interacting with people of different beliefs and ideologies.</p>
                        <p>All Muslims must refrain from a harsh, angry, and challenging approach,
                            for these are contrary to the Qur&#39;an&#39;s method and essence. Instead,
                            Muslims must adopt the accepting, moderate, calm, and rational approach
                            described in the Qur&#39;an. In other words, they must be role models for
                            humanity and earn people&#39;s admiration for the morality of Islam and
                            themselves. Muslims should also make great progress and produce superb works
                            of science, culture, art, and aesthetics, as well as live Islam in the best
                            way, and thus represent it to the world.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable
