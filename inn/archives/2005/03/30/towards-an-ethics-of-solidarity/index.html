                        <p>The fifth World Social Forum was held in January in Porto Alegra, Brazil,
                            bringing together groups from civil society who are interested in combating

                            whose emphasis was the relationship of religion to violent conflict and how

                        <h3>Religion, Conflict and Peace Discussed at World Social Forum</h3>
                        <p> &quot;When some two years ago in the West Indian State of Gujarat a train
                            compartment was bombed and 58 people were killed by unknown offenders, local
                            and regional newspapers published the headline &#39;58 people killed by
                            Muslim extremists&#39;. As a reaction, more than 2000 innocent Muslim Indians
                            were chased, raped and killed in a most cruel way in the week after the
                            bombing,&quot; Siddharta, leader of Fireflies, an interreligious Ashram in
                            Bangalore, India, recounts. &quot;What is the magma within religion that is
                            capable of such a brutal eruption?&quot; he asks. </p>
                        <p>Siddharta is speaking at a panel discussion on &quot;International ethics,
                            religious conflicts and peace&quot; at the fifth World Social Forum (WSF) in
                            Porto Alegre, Brazil. Organized by a global ecumenical coalition that
                            includes the World Council of Churches (WCC), the panel explores the role of
                            religion in conflicts, and seeks to identify resources within religion for
                            overcoming violence.</p>
                        <p>&quot;Religious conflicts are a reality that societies all over the world
                            have to live with,&quot; says another panel speaker, Rifat Kassis from
                            Palestine. The international coordinator of the World Council of Churches
                            (WCC) Ecumenical Accompaniment Programme in Palestine and Israel (EAPPI)
                            points to areas like Northern Ireland, the Sudan, Sri Lanka, and emphasizes:
                            &quot;What is happening in the Middle East is not unique.&quot;</p>
                        <p>As for Brazil, a country proud of its cultural mix and the peaceful
                            coexistence of people from different ethnic and religious backgrounds, it is
                            currently witnessing a denial of afro-Brazilian religions and traditions and
                            a growing wave of discrimination and violence against its black population.
                            &quot;Statistics show serious discrimination against black people whose
                            ancestors entered this country as slaves,&quot; reports Ordep Serra, a
                            Brazilian minister of the afro-Brazilian Candombl&eacute; religion.
                            &quot;Black people belong only to the lower classes. They are victims of
                            violence.&quot;</p>
                        <h3>Relational Ethics and a Relational Spirituality</h3>
                        <p>Religion has sometimes justified or even fuelled conflicts outside the
                            purely &quot;religious&quot; sphere, also involving political and economic
                            issues and powers. At the same time, a wide range of believers all over the
                            world are becoming increasingly aware of the relationships between religion,
                            violence and power and have developed ecumenical and interreligious
                            initiatives for peace.</p>
                        <p>Further examining the reasons for violence in the name of religion &mdash;
                            the magma &mdash; professor of theology Ulrich Duchrow from Germany links
                            newly erupting religious aggression to the presence of a new economic
                            paradigm. &quot;The market is driven by the neoliberal paradigm whose
                            psychological basis creates aggression and competition rather than
                            solidarity. Within this climate, the other is seen as a permanent
                            threat.&quot;</p>
                        <p>For Duchrow, individualism is a key issue. &quot;We won&#39;t survive with
                            an ethics that is considered as &#39;individual private value
                            judgement&#39;,&quot; says Duchrow, quoting sociologist Max Weber. &quot;If
                            we consider ethics as a condition for life, we mustn&#39;t see each other as
                            atomic individuals or as rivals but as closely connected beings. A future
                            ethics must be relational, it must be an ethics of solidarity.&quot;</p>
                        <p>Not only ethics, but also spirituality require openness towards the other.
                            Facing a world that today is ruled by a single empire and its allies,
                            &quot;One voice consisting of churches and social movements is required to
                            confront the fundamentalism of the market,&quot; Duchrow says.</p>
                        <p>From his interreligious perspective, Siddharta emphasizes that a
                            relational spirituality would also &quot;overcome the boundaries of different
                            faiths&quot;. And Palestinian Christian Kassis admits that: &quot;Even if we
                            focus on Christianity, we should not think that our religion is the only
                            peaceful one.&quot;</p>
                        <p>How would improved mutual understanding contribute towards a culture of
                            peace? From his particular context, Kassis stresses that it would prevent
                            fear of the unknown. The unknown other becomes the feared enemy. &quot;If you
                            don&#39;t know any Arabs, you could get the idea from certain media that
                            every Arab is a terrorist,&quot; he explains. In this context, the EAPPI is a
                            visible &quot;sign of hope&quot; in conflict areas. Accompaniers
                            &quot;undertake advocacy efforts, carry out non-violent actions and, by their
                            mere presence, promote peace and show a love that knows no
                            boundaries.&quot;</p>
                        <p>The sharing of initiatives from different contexts enables people to
                            realize the richness of religious diversity, fostering a culture of peace and
                            struggling to overcome violence. &quot;There will be no peace and no justice
                            if the present situation does not make you angry. The anger about things
                            going wrong in the world is the motive for change,&quot; Ordep Serra
                            concludes.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable
                    civilization, a global interfaith movement has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
