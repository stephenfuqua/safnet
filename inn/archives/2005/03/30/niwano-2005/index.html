                        <p>The Niwano Peace Foundation, a Buddhist organization that annually recognizes and honors
                            interreligious work through the Niwano Peace Prize, will this year honor Christian
                            theologian and interfaith activist Hans K&uuml;ng at a ceremony in Tokyo, Japan, on May 11,

                        <h3>Buddhist Peace Prize for Swiss Theologian</h3>
                        <p><b>swissinfo, February 22, 2005</b></p>
                        <p>Geneva, Switzerland &mdash; The renowned Swiss theologian, Hans K&uuml;ng,
                            is to receive an award by the Japanese Niwano Peace Foundation.</p>
                        <p>The laureate said he would use the prize, which is worth SFr224,000
                            ($192,275), for his Global Ethic Foundation.</p>
                        <p>The award ceremony is to take place in Tokyo on May 11. The panel said the
                            understanding and insight of the Catholic theologian were indispensable for
                            peace in the world, notably in the Middle East, Iraq and Sri Lanka.</p>
                        <p>&quot;Together with his contributions to interfaith dialogue and
                            cooperation, Dr K&uuml;ng&rsquo;s advocacy of a global ethic as a way of
                            realising peace has won him recognition around the world,&quot; the Niwano
                            Foundation said on Tuesday.</p>
                        <p>The Niwano Peace Prize is awarded on the basis of recommendations from
                            more than 1,000 leading figures across the world.</p>
                        <h3>Global Ethic Foundation</h3>
                        <p>The 76-year-old Swiss theologian said he would use most of the prize money
                            to support his Global Ethic Foundation, which aims to help teach children
                            basic ethical rules and understanding of values.</p>
                        <p>Last year K&uuml;ng received the Interfaith Education Award at the
                            Parliament of the World&rsquo;s Religions in Barcelona.</p>
                        <p>K&uuml;ng, an ordained priest, was professor of theology at T&uuml;bingen
                            University, Germany.</p>
                        <p>He became the first major Catholic theologian to reject papal
                            infallibility and repeatedly called for Pope John Paul II to step down for
                            health reasons.</p>
                        <p>K&uuml;ng&rsquo;s right to teach at Catholic universities was revoked by
                            the Vatican in 1979.</p>
                        <p>The Niwano Peace Foundation was set up in 1978 by Nikkyo Niwano, who
                            founded the Buddhist Rissho Kosei-kai organisation.</p>
                        <p>Previous prize winners include the late Brazilian archbishop Dom Helder
                            Camara, the Neve Shalom peace village, jointly established by Jews and
                            Palestinian Arabs in Israel, and the World Muslim Congress.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable
                    civilization, a global interfaith movement has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
