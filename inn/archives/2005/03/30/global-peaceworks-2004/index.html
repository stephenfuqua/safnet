                        <p>As the year 2004 ended with many
                            unresolved violent conflicts among religious communities, a group
                            of volunteers of diverse faiths gathered in New Delhi, India to prove that
                            peace among religions is indeed possible.</p>
                        <p>The group, Global PeaceWorks, &ldquo;Created a sense of family among
                            strangers of different national, cultural, religious, and socio-economic
                            backgrounds.&rdquo; Said volunteer Melissa Alvarez, a student service
                            specialist at Penn State University (USA), who made the trip as part of her
                            studies with
                            <a href="http://www.emmultimedia.com/unitedinterfaithministries/" target="_blank">United
                                Interfaith Ministries</a>. It was a &ldquo;life changing, perspective
                            shifting, heartwarming, and rejuvenating journey&rdquo; reported Alvarez who
                            was joined by volunteers from India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Japan, Taiwan, Kenya,
                            Iran and the United States.
                        </p>
                        <p>While some service organizations distance themselves from religion, Global
                            PeaceWorks focuses on religion as an essential component of human betterment.
                            &ldquo;Religion and spirituality help cultivate compassion and foster our
                            sense of interconnectedness as a human family.&rdquo; Says program
                            facilitator Eric Wenzel of New York. &ldquo;We have to go beyond the small
                            minded &lsquo;my religion is better&rsquo; thinking and work together,
                            honoring all sacred traditions, to solve global problems.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>Khorrum Omer, Global PeaceWorks India project director, has been working
                            in service and interfaith programs for two decades. Omer observed
                            &ldquo;There are interfaith groups that celebrate diversity and honor
                            different religious traditions with discussion, conferences or prayer
                            meetings, but Global PeaceWorks is different. We don&rsquo;t just shake hands
                            and say a prayer together. At Global PeaceWorks we say, &ldquo;Hey, these
                            children need our help &ndash; Let&rsquo;s go and serve them&hellip;
                            together. We are different faiths offering service together.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>Though Omer continues active involvement in his local Muslim community, he
                            knows no boundaries when it comes to service. In fact, when the Babri Masjid,
                            an Islamic holy site, was being torn down in 1992 by radical Hindus, Omer was
                            working with an interfaith group to restore a Hindu temple in Vrindaban.</p>
                        <p>In 2003, Omer led Global PeaceWorks in East Delhi where the group helped
                            build a community center in a challenged neighborhood with the
                            <a href="http://www.chetanalaya.org/" target="_blank">NGO Chetanalaya</a>.
                            For 2004, Omer chose <a href="http://www.amarjyotirehab.org/" target="_blank">Amar
                                Jyoti, a special school for physically and mentally challenged children</a> as the
                            service site. The service work was to carry
                            thousands of bricks up four flights of stairs to help with construction
                            &ndash; an arduous task.
                        </p>
                        <p>&ldquo;I picked up the first brick,&rdquo; realized Pinaki Chakraborty, a
                            child rights advocate and senior at Delhi University, &ldquo;Day after day,
                            children are carrying these bricks on their heads and in their hearts. They
                            might just keep on doing that if no action is taken.&rdquo; The thought
                            energized Chakraborty who worked tirelessly for hours on end. &ldquo;It is
                            hard work, but the most important rewards are spiritual&rdquo; commented
                            Durga Khadka, a volunteer from Kathmandu, Nepal.</p>
                        <p>The experience was enhanced by a visit to the
                            <a href="http://www.fatehpuri.org/">Fatehpuri Mosque in busy central
                                Delhi</a> and dialogue with its Imam, Dr. Mufti Mukarram Ahmed. An afternoon
                            at the <a href="http://www.bahaindia.org/temple/" target="_blank">Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute;
                                Lotus Temple</a>; conversations
                            with Sikh leaders at
                            <a href="http://allaboutsikhs.com/gurudwaras/gd-bangla.htm" target="_blank">Gurudwara
                                Bangla Sahib</a>; prayers, food and fun at

                                community</a>; and a trip to
                            <a href="http://www.rupeetravels.com/Vrindaban/Vrindaban.htm" target="_blank">Vrindaban</a>,
                            home to 5000 Hindu temples were also
                            included.
                        </p>
                        <p>The event made a lasting impact on the participant David Norenberg, a
                            creator of student interfaith programs at St. Lawrence University in New
                            York, who said, &ldquo;I don&#39;t think I will look at a globe or a map the
                            same way&hellip; The world has become infinitely more personal.&rdquo;&nbsp;
                            Christa Reynolds, creator of
                            <a href="http://www.enlightengamesinc.com/" target="_blank">&lsquo;<em>Enlighten</em>&rsquo;
                                the game of World Religions</a>, who served as a group leader for the
                            program, called the experience a &ldquo;wonderful adventure&rdquo; in
                            spiritual discovery and service.
                        </p>
                        <p>Dr. Deepali Bhanot, a professor of Sanskrit at Delhi University and a
                            program guide, remarked that the uniqueness of the program was in the
                            willingness of the volunteers to work in service while learning about each
                            other&rsquo;s culture. &ldquo;It was my best new year experience ever!&rdquo;
                            Shared Robert Hu of Taiwan, who holds the title of Mr. University from an
                            international contest he attended earlier in the year. &ldquo;We visited
                            temples, mosques and churches and listened to their stories, discussed their
                            beliefs, histories and offered prayers. Harmony could be felt
                            everywhere.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable

                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
