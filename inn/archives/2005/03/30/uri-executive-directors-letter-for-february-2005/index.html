                        <p>Dear Friends of the URI,
                            Greetings of love and peace.</p>
                        <p>As URI&#39;s global community grows as a force for peace, justice and
                            healing, we and all of humanity owe a debt of profound gratitude and support
                            to the visionary founders of the United Nations and to those people who
                            devote their lives to its success. A strong and effective UN is critical to
                            humanity&#39;s future. The UN inspired the birth of the URI and URI is
                            formally affiliated with the UN through the Department of Public Information.
                            There is a URI Cooperation Circle at the UN and many URI CCs around the world
                            have partnerships with local UN groups. In support of the UN and in the
                            spirit of global solidarity, I invite you to join your brothers and sisters
                            all over the world in three major United Nations&#39; observances in 2005,
                            one of which is also a major observance for URI:</p>

                            </li>
                            <li>September 21st, <a href="https://www.uri.org/">International Day of
                                    Peace</a></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>World Environment Day</strong>: WED was established by the
                            UN&#39;s General Assembly in 1972, on the same day the United Nations
                            Environmental Program (UNEP) was created, to deepen public awareness of the
                            need to preserve and enhance the environment. In 1987, Nairobi, Kenya became
                            the first city to host a global WED observance - <em>Environment and Shelter:
                                More Than A Roof</em>. In subsequent years, this annual observance has
                            focused on a wide variety of environmental issues: global warming, clean
                            water, the oceans, poverty and sustainable development.</p>
                        <p>This year San Francisco will host WED, the first city in North America to
                            have this honor. The theme is Green Cities, which the host committee believes
                            &quot;is timely because the 21st century marks the first time in human
                            history that the majority of the world&#39;s population will live in urban
                            areas. Today, cities consume 75% of the planet&#39;s natural resources. As
                            urban populations grow, it is increasingly important to balance the needs of
                            the environment, the economy, and social equity if we are going to achieve a
                            way of living that can support our planet and our people into future
                            generations.&quot; URI is a partner in this effort. Our purpose calls us
                            &quot;to create cultures of peace, justice and healing for the Earth and all
                            living beings.&quot; We encourage you to visit the WED website
                            (<a href="https://www.worldenvironmentday.global/">www.wed2005.org</a>) for ideas about how
                            you can share in this global observance.</p>
                        <p><strong>UN &amp; URI Charters</strong>: June 26, 2005 marks the 60th
                            Anniversary of UN Charter and the global institution it created, which has
                            inspired and supported countless leaders over the past sixty years to make an
                            extra effort for peace and justice.</p>

                        <p>June 25, 2005 is also the 5th Anniversary of URI Charter and the global
                            community it created, which daily brings people together across faith lines
                            to build a more peaceful and just world.</p>
                        <blockquote>

                        </blockquote>
                        <p>In these times when the need for global cooperation among nations and
                            faiths is made vivid each day, we urge you to find ways to celebrate this
                            important anniversary.</p>
                        <p><strong>International Day of Peace</strong>: The International Day of
                            Peace was established by the UN in 1981. Originally tied to the yearly
                            opening of the General Assembly, in 2001 its date was fixed annually on
                            September 21. For the past two years, members of the URI community around the
                            world have joined in celebrating this day with a wide array of activities
                            that demonstrate the power of shared action for peace. We invite you, again,
                            to join with your sisters and brothers around the world in helping this day
                            become a major global celebration.</p>
                        <p>We will be sharing more about these observances as the year progresses,
                            but we invite you now to put these dates on your calendar and begin planning
                            how you and your community will participate. Please let us know what
                            you&#39;re planning by emailing office@uri.org. Together we can build
                            communities of peace, justice and healing for a better future.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable
                    civilization, a global interfaith movement has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
