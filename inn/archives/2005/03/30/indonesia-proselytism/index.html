                        <p>Christian and Muslim leaders work to dispel rumors of rampant proselytism in
                            Aceh province, the staunchly-Islamic Indonesian province and site of the most
                            widespread destruction in the wake of the December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. </p>

                        <p>JAKARTA, Indonesia, FEB. 4, 2005 (Zenit.org) &mdash; Muslim and Christian
                            leaders issued a joint statement to dispel fears that post-tsunami
                            humanitarian aid being provided in the Indonesian province of Aceh is a means
                            of proselytism.</p>
                        <p>Articles appearing in the American and Indonesian press suggested that
                            evangelical Christian organizations which arrived in Indonesia to help in the
                            wake of the tsunami had objectives that were more religious than
                            humanitarian.</p>
                        <p>Responding energetically, Indonesia&#39;s Christian communities denounced
                            all attempts to use the humanitarian mission to evangelize as this is in
                            direct opposition to the spirit and teaching of true Christianity, reported
                            Fides news agency.</p>
                        <p>The leaders urged the international Christian communities who want to help
                            children affected by the tsunami in Aceh and North Sumatra to work in
                            cooperation with the Muslim Nahdlatul Ulama and Muhannadiyah organizations
                            &mdash; the latter represents 40 million Muslims in Indonesia &mdash; as
                            agreed by the Christian bishops and Muslim leaders.</p>
                        <p>The signatories of the statement applauded the efforts of the Indonesian
                            government to prevent affected children from being taken way from Aceh for
                            treatment, and asked people not to be caught up by rumors.</p>
                        <p>&quot;We hope that all polemics that are unproductive to humanitarian work
                            in Aceh and North Sumatra be swiftly ended. Now is the time for us to work
                            together to overcome this national disaster. May God, creator and guardian of
                            life bless our efforts,&quot; the leaders stated.</p>
                        <p>The statement was signed by seven Muslim and Christian religious
                            representatives, including Father Benny Susetyo, secretary of the
                            Interreligious Dialogue Commission of the Indonesian episcopal
                            conference.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable

                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
