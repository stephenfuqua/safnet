                        <p>April 7, 2005. San Francisco, USA &ndash; The United Religions Initiative
                            Global Council in March voted to endorse the Darfur Unity Statement in
                            recognition of the continuing necessity for international intervention in the
                            Darfur region of Sudan. Originally signed by over 100 non-governmental
                            agencies in July of 2004, the Save Darfur Coalition&#39;s Unity Statement
                            remains relevant today with over two million refugees in need of aid and
                            death toll estimates in the region now exceeding 300,000 (the statement can
                            be found at <a href="http://www.savedarfur.org/">www.savedarfur.org</a>).</p>
                        <p>Many statements of &ldquo;never again&rdquo; followed the terrible
                            massacres in Rwanda eleven years ago today. Yet January&#39;s report from the
                            UN International Inquiry on Darfur made clear that the conflict in western
                            Sudan would soon become the next &quot;never again.&quot; In spite of the
                            international attention the region received last summer, the Commission was
                            &quot;particularly alarmed that attacks on villages, killing of civilians,
                            rape, pillaging and forced displacements have continued during the course of
                            the Commission&#39;s mandate.&quot;</p>
                        <p>Alarmed at the lack of resolution to this crisis, a small group of
                            interfaith activists informally convened in March as the URI Darfur Action
                            Group. Representing URI members from across the United States and from
                            Brazil, Israel, Ethiopia, Nepal, Pakistan and Chile, the group requested that
                            the URI Global Council show its solidarity and desire for peace by endorsing
                            the Unity Statement. &quot;Even in this late day we are not powerless to act,
                            to help a desperate people avoid further atrocities and the suffering of
                            refugee life,&quot; said one of the group&#39;s conveners, Stephen Fuqua.
                            &quot;Though the URI Global Council cannot make policy pronouncements on
                            behalf of URI members, it can speak for itself.&quot; Reporting on the
                            Council&#39;s agreement to support the Unity Statement, URI Executive
                            Director Charles Gibbs said &quot;the Standing Committee
                            enthusiastically supports having URI be added as a signatory to the Unity
                            Statement. Akey factor leading to the committee&#39;s support was that the
                            request came from our grassroots representatives and members who had been
                            seriously considering this issue.&quot;</p>
                        <p>In March the URI Darfur Action Group additionally sent a letter to
                            interfaith leaders throughout the United States requesting their support for
                            a campaign to encourage passage of the Darfur Accountability Act in the US
                            Senate. Recent Security Council Resolutions have finally begun to make
                            inroads toward punishing perpetrators of crimes against humanity and
                            sanctioning individuals and the government of Sudan. They have also approved
                            a much-needed peacekeeping force for southern Sudan, whose future stability
                            is intertwined with the conflict in the west. The Accountability Act would
                            provide additional American aid in the region and work to secure additional
                            African Union and UN peacekeeping troops specifically for Darfur.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable

                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
