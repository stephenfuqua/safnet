                    <p class="author">By Barbara Hartford, United Religions Initiative Global Support Staff</p>

                        <p>In John Paul Lederach&#39;s new book,
                            <em><a
                                    href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0195174542/ref=ase_spiritofglorythe/002-0506963-0314428?v=glance&amp;s=books">
                                    Moral Imagination: the Art and Soul of Building Peace</a>,</em> he addresses
                            the question: &ldquo;How do we transcend the cycles of violence that bewitch
                            our human community while still living in them?&rdquo;&nbsp; URI&#39;s
                            approach to interfaith peacebuilding&nbsp;through our&nbsp;Principles and
                            networked organization are thoroughly validated in this call for the <i>moral
                                imagination;</i> at the same time we&rsquo;re challenged to make&nbsp;our
                            efforts&nbsp;more&nbsp;effective through strategic and intentional
                            networking.
                        </p>
                        <p>Lederach addresses peacebuilding as both a learned skill and as an
                            art.&nbsp; He suggests and explores <i>moral imagination</i> as &ldquo;the
                            capacity to imagine something rooted in the challenges of the real world yet
                            capable of giving birth to that which does not yet exist.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><em>The Moral Imagination</em> is built around&nbsp;four guiding
                            stories,&nbsp;using&nbsp;concepts and metaphors&nbsp;from the arts (Haiku
                            poetry) and&nbsp;nature (spider webs).&nbsp; He eloquently articulates the
                            importance of seredipity as &quot;the gift of life&#8230; It keeps us alive to
                            constant growth and unending potential, if we develop a capacity to see what
                            is found along the way and adapt creatively while keeping a keen sense of
                            purpose.&quot;</p>
                        <p>Charles Gibbs has said: &ldquo;What excites me about the book is
                            Lederach&rsquo;s identification and unpacking of the four disciplines and the
                            two directions of exploration. In his efforts &ndash; including working with
                            the skill and art of peacebuilding &ndash; I find a great deal that both
                            supports URI&rsquo;s work (we are doing so much that is resonant with his
                            articulation of the art of peacebuilding) and a great deal that challenges us
                            to take our efforts to a deeper level &ndash; developing more of the skill of
                            this discipline, and, in the context of his understanding of critical mass
                            &ndash; being strategic in our web building so we engage the people who can
                            leverage large scale change.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>As John Paul Lederach says: &ldquo;Stated simply, the moral imagination
                            requires the capacity to imagine ourselves in a web of relationships that
                            includes our enemies; the ability to sustain a paradoxical curiosity that
                            embraces complexity without reliance on dualistic polarity; the fundamental
                            belief in and pursuit of the creative act; and the acceptance of the inherent
                            risk of stepping into the mystery of the unknown that lies beyond the too
                            familiar landscape of violence.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>His two broad directions of exploration are to &ldquo;understand and feel
                            the landscape of protracted violence and why it poses such deep-rooted
                            challenges to constructive change&rdquo; and to &ldquo;explore the creative
                            process as the wellspring that feeds the building of peace.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>John Paul Lederach is a leading peacebuilding teacher, trainer, and
                            practitioner (Northern Ireland, Nicaragua, Somalia, Tajikistan, The
                            Philippines), teacher and trainer.&nbsp; He is currently Professor of
                            International Peacebuilding at the Joan B. Kroc Institute of International
                            Peace Studies at the University of Notre Dame and Distinguished Scholar at
                            Eastern Mennonite University&rsquo;s Conflict Transformation Program.&nbsp;
                            He has been an inspiration for URI peacebuilding since Christine Kisembo and
                            I first studied with him at EMU/CTP several years ago. He sees his work as a
                            religious vocaton.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable
                    civilization, a global interfaith movement has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
