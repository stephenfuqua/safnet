                        <p>Annie Imbens-Fransen is a Feminist theologian. In 1986, she founded the
                            <em>Foundation for Pastoral Care for Women</em> to provide pastoral care and
                            counseling to sexually abused women with a religious trauma. She has
                            lectured and published extensively on the impact of a religious education on the lives of
                            women, including the books: <em>Christianity and Incest</em> and <em>God in
                                Women&rsquo;s Lives.</em> She is the initiator and coordinator of the
                            URI Council for women and served as a
                            member of the URI Europe board and the URI Global Council.

                        <p><strong>Q: I&rsquo;m interested in sharing both people&rsquo;s stories and
                                their specific ideas about interfaith activism. So to begin, will you tell us
                                something about your religious background?</strong></p>
                        <p>I was raised as a Roman Catholic. Being raised as a Roman Catholic
                            continues to be a source of inspiration. Different nuns, priests and teachers
                            have inspired and encouraged me during my life. However, I was also often
                            surprised about the rules and views in my religion, particularly the views on
                            women and on other faith traditions. During my first year at primary school,
                            I was taught that only Roman Catholics would go to heaven, while people from
                            another faith and unbelievers would go to hell. I was not allowed to play
                            with Protestant children.</p>
                        <p>In 1943 at the age of six, I heard for the first time the story of Adam
                            and Eve and the creation of the world. At that time, because of the German
                            occupation, my classroom was temporarily lodged in a wooden sports complex.
                            During air-raid alarms, we had to take shelter in houses across the street.
                            Hearing about the paradise, I started dreaming away from the reality I was
                            living in. I imagined Adam and Eve who lived in freedom and had the disposal
                            of all the fruits and plants God had created. I was told that this wonderful
                            life was still not enough for Eve, which made her decide to eat from the
                            forbidden tree. The story concluded with the explanation that Eve caused the
                            original sin, because of her eating from that tree. This was interpreted as
                            the beginning of all sins and evil in the world. As a consequence, Eve was
                            held responsible for the hunger and for the bombs and the ravages in my
                            neighborhood. I could not understand how this woman Eve could have been so
                            irresponsible and reckless to put at stake such a good life in paradise for
                            all the people who came after her.&nbsp; I felt angry with her and
                            disappointed.</p>
                        <p>A few years later, after the liberation, our class went to the church to
                            prepare ourselves for the first communion. While we were standing at the
                            sanctuary, a priest explained about the mass and the consecration. He showed
                            us the different regalia and made clear that women and girls were not allowed
                            to stay at the sanctuary during the mass and that only boys and men could
                            serve. After that, he explained that the altar-cloth was washed by nuns, but
                            only after it had first been flushed in water by a priest. In this way
                            priests prevented that women&rsquo;s hands could touch crumbs of the
                            consecrated bread that could have been fallen on the cloth. He showed us the
                            holy well where priests poured the first flushing water of this altar-cloth.
                            This preparation for my first communion gave me the depressing impression
                            that there was something wrong with girls and women, but I could not
                            understand why. Some weeks later at the home of a girlfriend, I heard that
                            she had to help her younger brother to learn Latin texts, because he was
                            preparing to become an altar boy. He could hardly read, but he could serve at
                            the mass as altar boy, because he was a boy. My girlfriend and I who helped
                            him could not, because we were girls. At that moment, I felt the church was
                            favoring boys above girls and thought this an unjust treatment of girls.</p>
                        <p>At the age of 12 and 15, I was offered scholarships. My parents however
                            thought it not necessary for me as a girl to continue studying. They thought
                            it important for me to find a job to make it possible for my elder brother to
                            continue his study. I got an administrative job and followed different
                            courses to become a secretary. After being married and having three children
                            I started organizing and coordinating parent&rsquo;s councils, environment
                            and peace organizations and different innovative activities in the church. I
                            was offered training for social worker, and I got two temporary part-time
                            posts as social worker.</p>
                        <p>In 1979, I started studying theology. I wanted to learn how to read and
                            interpret biblical texts, as I often felt uncomfortable with the way priests
                            used and interpreted these texts. During my first year, I became a member of
                            the <em>Committee Perspectives for Theologians.</em> The chair of that
                            committee, an inspiring professor and priest, told me that notwithstanding my
                            enthusiasm, I would have problems with finding a job in the Roman Catholic
                            Church, because of my three handicaps: being a woman, being married and
                            having children. I also became a member of a <em>Women&rsquo;s Studies
                                Theology</em> group. Together we read books from Dutch and American feminist
                            theologians, and we explored methods to interpret biblical texts from
                            women&rsquo;s perspective.</p>
                        <p>Two of my papers <em>Thecla, an Apostle besides Paul</em> and<em>The Myth
                                of Male Superiority, and the Image of God</em>were published in a Roman
                            Catholic magazine.</p>
                        <p>I started giving lectures and courses <em>Reading the Bible with
                                Women&rsquo;s Eyes.</em> From that moment on women started telling me about
                            their problems with their religious education, and about their experiences
                            with rape and incest. Hearing these women&rsquo;s stories increased my
                            awareness of the negative and harmful spiritual contents of mainstream
                            androcentric and patriarchal theology for women and children. My realization
                            of androcentrism in mainstream theology and Christian tradition led me to
                            become a feminist.</p>
                        <p>Several research projects revealed how destructive and oppressive
                            androcentric; patriarchal Christian thought and spirituality can be to women.
                            The study <em>Christianity and Incest</em> (Imbens &amp; Jonker, 1985/1992)
                            led to the conclusion: &ldquo;When Christian upbringing is seen from the
                            perspective of patriarchal premises, the experience and teaching of
                            Christianity makes girls easy prey for male family members. This religious
                            education complicates the woman&rsquo;s or girl&rsquo;s ability to overcome
                            the effects of sexual abuse.&rdquo; I tried to incorporate pastoral care and
                            counseling for survivors of rape and incest with a religious trauma within
                            existing religious and health care organizations, as I did not succeed, I
                            founded the <em>Foundation for Pastoral Care for Women</em></p>
                        <p><strong>Q: How did you become involved with interfaith activities? Was
                                there any particular event or person that inspired you to work with people of
                                faiths other than your own?</strong></p>
                        <p>Since the 1980s, I had contacts with many Protestant women and
                            women&rsquo;s organizations and communities. Participating in the
                            <em>Women&rsquo;s Studies Theology</em> group to develop methods to read the
                            Bible with women&rsquo;s eyes, particularly the way the Protestant theologian
                            Dr. Fokkelien van Dijk-Hemmes organized courses and workshops, continues to
                            be a source of inspiration. I started giving lectures, workshops and courses
                            for Catholic and Protestant and women&rsquo;s organizations and communities.
                            When giving workshops about reading the Bible with women&rsquo;s eyes, we
                            often closed the day with a ceremony prepared by participants. A highlight
                            was the ceremony organized on request of Protestant women with Protestant and
                            Roman Catholic women on the suffering of women in the week before Easter.
                        </p>
                        <p>In 1996, I started a project to interview women from different faith
                            traditions on their views on religion and spirituality. When participating in
                            a research colloquium of the <em>Association for Religion and Intellectual
                                Life</em> (ARIL), I met Ghazala Sharif, a Muslim woman. From the first moment
                            on, we shared our views on women, religion and spirituality. The second day
                            she read the poem <em>Song of the Bird, True Spirituality</em> from Anthony
                            de Mello and told me &ldquo;This is what your work is about.&rdquo; During
                            four weeks, we together read texts from the Bible and the Quran, and she gave
                            me a Quran. Similar things happened when having a dialogue with Gila Gevirtz,
                            a Jewish woman. We continue to keep contact with each other. In 2004, at the
                            <em>Assembly of the Parliament of the World&rsquo;s Religions</em>, Ghazala
                            and I organized a workshop <em>Interpreting Religious Texts from the
                                Perspective of Women&rsquo;s and Children&rsquo;s Human Rights</em>.
                        </p>
                        <p>Another inspiring experience occurred in 1997, at the first regional
                            United Religions Initiative conference. Women took the initiative to form a
                            group around the theme <em>Women&rsquo;s Experiences and Views on Religion
                                and Spirituality</em>. In this group women and men (including priests and an
                            imam) from different European countries and from different religious
                            backgrounds: Christian, Muslim, Sikh, Zoroaster and Brahma Kumaris
                            participated. We spoke honestly to each other and asked each other sometimes
                            difficult questions. This open atmosphere enabled a Christian woman to say to
                            the imam: &ldquo;I have never been in a women&rsquo;s group with an imam, and
                            honestly say I am afraid of you. It makes me try to behave nice to you, but I
                            also want to express my anger about the oppression of women in
                            religions.&rdquo; Her words created an opening to go deeper into
                            women&rsquo;s concerns about the impact of religion on women&rsquo;s lives.
                            The imam explained that Muslim men feel the need to protect women. By asking
                            him how it would feel if women would protect men in the same way he said:
                            &ldquo;You are right, it is patronizing women.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>We also shared our favorite texts from our religious and cultural
                            traditions. We took care that the wife of the imam, who did not speak
                            English, but could understand it enough to follow the conversation, could
                            participate by asking her for her opinion and asking her husband to translate
                            her words. It was impressive to hear her husband translate: &ldquo;In
                            religions there is no justice for women. That is the same in all religions.
                            In all religions women are oppressed.&rdquo; At the end of the conference,
                            the imam told us that his wife was going to learn to speak English, and he
                            explained: &ldquo;So that she can speak for herself at
                            conferences.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>Other impressive moments are the dialogues with an orthodox Jewish rabbi
                            about kosher food, images of God, and the position of women; a Muslim man and
                            milieu activist from India about feminism and the milieu. Being in dialogue
                            with women and men from different faith traditions deepens my understanding
                            and my faith.</p>
                        <p>I am grateful for Mohinder Singh&rsquo;s support for my proposal to
                            include principle 8 in the URI Charter: <strong>We practice equitable
                                participation of women and men in all aspects of URI.</strong> Thanks to his
                            support my frequent requests to include such a principle was unanimously
                            accepted by the Interim Global Council at the very last moment.</p>
                        <p><strong>Q: I know that you are passionate about women&rsquo;s rights
                                (incidentally, these questions were written on International Women&rsquo;s
                                Day, March 8).&nbsp; hat do you see as the most significant challenges facing
                                women today? In Europe specifically? Elsewhere in the world?</strong></p>
                        <p>Interviewing, counseling and speaking with hundreds of survivors of rape
                            and incest from all over the world led to my thesis: &ldquo;Sexual violence
                            against women and girls is a cultural phenomenon in our society, which can
                            befall any woman at any place and at any time, regardless of her age and
                            regardless of her relationship to the offender.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>Different UN officials continue to express that violence against women
                            continues to be pervasive worldwide. At the fourth International Day for the
                            Elimination of Violence against Women on 25 November 2003, Noeleen Heyzer
                            executive director of the UN Women&rsquo;s Fund (UNIFEM) said:
                            &ldquo;Violence against women has become as much a pandemic as HIV/AIDS, or
                            malaria. But it is still generally downplayed by the public at large and by
                            policy-makers who fail to create and fund programs to eradicate it.&rdquo;
                            She indicated that globally, one in three women will be raped, beaten,
                            coerced into sex or otherwise abused in her lifetime, and wondered why
                            gender-based violence continues, seemingly unabated, despite the hard work by
                            women&rsquo;s institutions to have women&rsquo;s right recognized.</p>
                        <p>UN secretary general Kofi Annan expressed that gender-based violence is
                            perhaps the most shameful human rights violation. &ldquo;As long as it
                            continues, we cannot claim to be making real progress towards equality,
                            development and peace.&rdquo; He called on all sectors of society to redouble
                            their efforts to achieve the objective of ending all forms of violence
                            against women. He expressed that: &ldquo;This will require leadership at
                            every level, in every culture, country and continent. It will require a bold
                            transformation in men&rsquo;s attitudes and behavior so that women become
                            their equal partners.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>In 2004, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan affirmed that despite the
                            important legal framework set up by the UN, regional organizations and
                            national governments through resolutions, guidelines and reports condemning
                            all forms of violence against women, the collective response to violence
                            against women is &ldquo;inadequate&rdquo; in comparison to the magnitude of
                            the problem.</p>
                        <p>The United Nations Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of
                            Women (INSTRAW) expresses that the shifts in consciousness that led to the
                            establishment of laws, conventions and declarations on violence against women
                            need to be translated into shifts in behavior. They indicate that campaigns
                            launched by national and international Non Governmental Organizations and
                            Women&rsquo;s Organizations are most effective. They refer to the campaign of
                            The World March of Women 2000, which they refer to as an &ldquo;an
                            unprecedented series of actions in 157 countries, demanding that the United
                            Nations and its Member States take concrete measurers to eliminate poverty
                            and ensure fair distribution of the planet&rsquo;s wealth between rich and
                            poor, and between men and women; and to eliminate violence and discrimination
                            against women.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>We may expect that the alarming details of the worldwide violations of
                            children&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s human rights and the urgent appeal of UN
                            officials will open the hearts of religious people and inspire and motivate
                            us all to stop this violence.</p>
                        <p><strong>Q: How are you involved locally in women&rsquo;s issues and how
                                much of that activity is through interfaith organizations?</strong></p>
                        <p>Until a few years ago, I was actively involved locally, but it was
                            difficult to combine it with my European and global URI activities. At this
                            moment, I am active in the Dutch sector of the <em>World March of Women.</em>
                            We discussed the first draft of the <em>Women&rsquo;s Global Charter for
                                Humanity</em>, launched on December 10, 2004 in Rwanda.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>The World March of Women proposes to build another world where
                            exploitation, oppression, intolerance and exclusion no longer exist, and
                            where integrity, diversity and the rights and freedoms of all are respected.
                            The values <strong>equality, freedom, solidarity, justice, and peace</strong>
                            are described as the driving force. Under each value different affirmations
                            are given, some refer to the role of religions.</p>
                        <p><strong>Equality,</strong> affirmation 3: No custom, tradition, religion,
                            ideology, economic system or policy justifies the inferiorization of any
                            person or authorizes actions that undermine human dignity, and physical and
                            psychological integrity.</p>
                        <p><strong>Peace,</strong> affirmation 5: No custom, tradition, ideology,
                            religion, political or economic system justifies the use of violence.</p>
                        <p>Until October 17, activities are organized in 166 countries. For
                            information about the activities in these countries and for the complete text
                            of the Charter, see their website:

                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Q: Do you see any unique role interfaith organizations can play in
                                promoting the dignity and equality of women?</strong></p>
                        <p>Since the <em>World&rsquo;s Parliament of Religions</em> held in 1893 its
                            first interreligious conference in Chicago many other initiatives have been
                            taken to foster interreligious dialogue and co-operation. Understanding and
                            co-operation among people from different religious and cultural traditions
                            and peace among nations are generally described as the main goals to be
                            achieved. Considering the worldwide violations of human rights, and
                            considering the role of religions in these violations, the interreligious
                            forum should first of all be a space where religions work together to
                            establish the full human rights of all human beings, including the right to
                            freedom of thought, conscience and religion. In view of the statistics on the
                            worldwide violations of women&rsquo;s human rights, it is most important to
                            focus in the interreligious dialogue on the human rights of women and
                            children and on the impact of religions on their lives.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>That makes it necessary for interreligious organizations to practice equal
                            participation of women and men in all aspects of the organization.</p>
                        <p>Participating at the Assembly of the Parliament of the World&rsquo;s
                            Religions in July 2004, <em>Pathways to peace: the wisdom of listening, the
                                power of commitment</em> made again clear to me that the contribution of
                            religion for the protection and implementation of women&rsquo;s human rights
                            continues to be a controversial issue when male religious leaders of
                            hierarchical and male dominated religious institutions set the tone at such a
                            gathering. In Barcelona, female and male participants expressed their
                            disappointment and anger about the invisibility of women and the male
                            dominance at this assembly, and the lack of respect for the minority of women
                            who participated in panels. After discovering two young female students
                            crying in the hall near the bathroom because of this atmosphere, I organized
                            an Open Space Gathering <em>Listening to the Voices of Women in the
                                Parliament of the World&rsquo;s Religions</em>. About 200 women and some men
                            participated. Two volunteers organized translation for Spanish participants.
                            Participants were invited to express: why they had come to this open space
                            gathering; what they hoped to achieve; how we could best achieve our
                            expectations.</p>
                        <p>The majority of the participants clearly expressed the necessity of the
                            elimination of male dominance in religions; solidarity; respect for
                            women&rsquo;s human rights; listening to the voices of women.</p>
                        <p>A committee of 12 volunteers was formed (eleven women and one man), who
                            prepared a <em>Petition with Recommendations to the Council of the Parliament
                                of the World&rsquo;s Religions.</em> We asked for permission to read the
                            recommendations at the closing ceremony. As this proved to be impossible we
                            made copies and handed them to participants after the closing ceremony. The
                            recommendations clearly express the important role interfaith organizations
                            need to play in today&rsquo;s world in promoting the dignity and equality of
                            women.</p>
                        <p><strong>Recommendation to the Council for a Parliament of the
                                World&rsquo;s Religions:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The focus of the Parliament &ldquo;agenda&rdquo; should include the
                                gender inequality in the world&rsquo;s religious and spiritual
                                traditions.&nbsp;</li>
                            <li>Equal numbers of women and men should be present on all programs.</li>
                            <li>There are gender issues embedded in every topic.&nbsp; Women&rsquo;s
                                experiences often differ from mainstream interpretations.&nbsp; This should
                                consistently be reflected in the presentations.</li>
                            <li>Scholars of women in religion and feminist scholars should be included
                                in every program.</li>
                            <li>The interpretation of religious and spiritual texts from the
                                perspective of women&rsquo;s and children&rsquo;s human rights should be
                                given priority.</li>
                            <li>Broader criteria for selection of &ldquo;experts&rdquo; must also be
                                considered.&nbsp; The emphasis put upon &ldquo;experts&rdquo; as a
                                criterion for participant selection often excludes the primary concerns of
                                women because women have been denied the opportunities for professional
                                advancement.</li>
                            <li>Experiences from women&rsquo;s interfaith projects show that emphasis
                                placed on building relations facilitates constructive dialogue.&nbsp; The
                                format of programs should include, as a priority, group dialogues and the
                                creation of space for co-equal conversations that produce collective
                                insights.</li>
                            <li>Experts in the study of women and religion and feminist scholars should
                                be included in every program.</li>
                            <li>Women often have less opportunity for education, employment and
                                economic resources.&nbsp; This means they are less able to participate in
                                Parliament activities.&nbsp; We propose that the Parliament actively
                                sponsor women by developing partnerships that provide financial
                                support.&nbsp; This also applies to other marginalised groups.</li>
                            <li>An equal number of women and men (including feminist scholars) should
                                be members of the Parliament&rsquo;s governing bodies, especially the
                                program task force and the advisors to the program task force.&nbsp;</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>At other interreligious conferences and workshops women and men expressed
                            what they thought the necessary contribution of religious and interreligious
                            organizations:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>to listen to the voices of women,</li>
                            <li>to cooperate with women&rsquo;s organizations that are working
                                tirelessly to have women&rsquo;s human rights recognized,</li>
                            <li>to reinterpret sacred texts shaped by patriarchy,</li>
                            <li>to read religious texts from the perspective of children&rsquo;s and
                                women&rsquo;s human rights,</li>
                            <li>to read studies from feminist scholars and theologians,</li>
                            <li>to stop promoting the subordination of women as being according to

                        <p><strong>Q: Is there anything else you&rsquo;d like to add for our
                                readers?</strong></p>
                        <p>After considering many women&#39;s stories about their daily lives and
                            reflecting on my own experiences, especially during my study of theology and
                            my work in theology and pastoral care for women, I discovered two different
                            sides to spirituality.</p>
                        <p>First, <em>spirituality</em> is a stimulating and empowering source of
                            strength and insight that grows as we become more receptive and realize our
                            abilities and limitations. Inner strength stimulates us to open our eyes to
                            the structures, mechanisms, and limitations in our society that support
                            unjust practices and relations and to the suffering, they cause. Spirituality
                            also cultivates our insight, self-esteem, strength, courage, creativity, and
                            sensitivity to truth, justice, beauty, and love, which are the necessary
                            instruments or attributes for transforming ourselves and our societies and
                            for creating a better life for all beings. This quality is conveyed through
                            words, attitudes and gestures, paintings and sculptures, music and dance, and
                            poems and stories. Biographical stories express how and where we find hope,
                            strength, perseverance, vitality, and joy in daily life, even under difficult
                            circumstances.</p>
                        <p>This view on spirituality emanates from texts and stories from my
                            Christian heritage and from many women&rsquo;s stories. Two biblical texts
                            have acquired a special meaning to me. The first answers the question: What
                            is needed to inherit eternal life or enjoy the fullest possible existence?
                            According to the answer, we should love God, the supreme being,
                            wholeheartedly, with all our soul, all our strength, and all our mind, and we
                            should love our neighbor as we love ourselves. (Luke 10:27). The second text
                            is a story about a widow who was involved in a lawsuit. The judge who heard
                            her case neither feared God nor respected people. After refusing for a while,
                            he finally granted her justice. The widow succeeded in convincing this judge
                            of his obligation to dispense justice by repeatedly telling him:
                            &ldquo;Provide me justice against my opponent.&rdquo; She persisted until the
                            judge sighed: &ldquo;I have no fear of God and no respect for anyone, yet
                            because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see to it that she gets her
                            rights. If I do not, she will keep on coming and finally wear me out.&rdquo;
                            This story advises us how we should believe and pray. It also expresses the
                            power of justice and the wisdom and strength of a woman who knew how to
                            obtain her rights before an unjust or corrupt judge. (Luke 18:1-8).</p>
                        <p>Studying theology and receiving instruction exclusively from male teachers
                            made me aware of the male domination in Christianity and mainstream theology.
                            I discovered that mainstream theology marginalizes and ignores women and
                            children and their experiences, problems, feelings, interests, insights, and
                            talents and imposes androcentric and patriarchal views about God and the
                            world&rsquo;s creation and ideal order on women and children. Mainstream
                            androcentric theology views reality on the basis of the experiences,
                            feelings, and insights of men who consider themselves superior to women and
                            children.</p>
                        <p>Androcentric spirituality also figures in biblical texts and stories from
                            my Christian heritage and in their androcentric interpretations. The texts
                            Ephesians 5:22-33 and 1 Timothy 2:11-15 are notorious. In the first text,
                            wives are told to submit to their husbands as unto God. This text fosters
                            inequality in relationships between husbands and wives. The second passage
                            prohibits women from teaching but has them study in silence instead. It
                            explains the cause and manner of the violation of women&rsquo;s human right
                            to freedom of speech in Christian tradition: because Adam was created before
                            Eve, and because Adam was not deceived, while Eve was deceived and became a
                            transgressor. The passage concludes that women will be redeemed through
                            childbearing, &ldquo;provided they continue in faith and love and holiness
                            with modesty.&rdquo; As long as texts and ideas such as these are interpreted
                            by people raised as Christians as God&rsquo;s law, they stimulate acceptance
                            and justification of women&rsquo;s subordination.</p>

                        <p>I met you a few years ago, but you may not recall me. It was good to read your interview. At
                            one point I tried to get involved in a URI cc around women&#8217;s issues, but I never

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable
