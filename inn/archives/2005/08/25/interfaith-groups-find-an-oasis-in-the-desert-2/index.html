                        <p>Blistering weather reports from Las Vegas notwithstanding, 140 interfaith
                            leaders from Canada, Mexico, and the United States gathered in southern
                            Nevada on August 12. For four and a half days the group explored a complex
                            set of themes &ndash; &ldquo;Hospitality, Generosity and Sharing &ndash;
                            Interfaith Action in Our World.&rdquo; The weather turned out to be dry and
                            kind, the heat tempered by passing storms. University of Nevada Las Vegas is
                            beautiful and proved an exemplar of the hospitality we were discussing.</p>

                        <p><i>Reprinted with permission from <a href="http://www.uri-na.org/wp/">URI-NA
                                    Briefings</a></i></p>
                        <p>More than 30 &lsquo;how-to&rsquo; workshops were presented, with
                            &ldquo;The Rise of Christian Fundamentalism and its Impact on Interfaith
                            Work,&rdquo; &ldquo;Southern Sudan Education Project,&rdquo; and
                            &ldquo;Community Foundation Fundraising&rdquo; popular enough to bear
                            repeating. Peacemaking, community, and creation each were explored in a
                            series of sessions that ran throughout the conference. A site visit the first
                            day took a busload to Child Haven, a state-supported center that works with
                            9,000 abused and abandoned children a year. We saw how faith communities can
                            participate in this historic work.</p>
                        <p>Content rich, in other words! Some thought we ran a day too long. Most,
                            though, were energized rather than exhausted by the smorgasbord, and few left
                            before the end.</p>
                        <h2>In the evening&hellip;</h2>
                        <p>Evening programs were the highlight for many, unexpected and deeply moving
                            events. An opening banquet was set in a ballroom. Over 300 attended, the
                            conferees sitting down with several dozen Muslim families from southern
                            Nevada who had prepared the feast. They brought enough food to have fed us
                            all twice and still have leftovers. We were warmly welcomed. At each table
                            hosts shared stories and pictures of the different countries they came from
                            on the way to citizenship here. After we ate, a Moroccan concert on drums and
                            the oud, a plucked Middle Eastern instrument, was astonishing. Muslim
                            hospitality set the tone for the whole conference.</p>
                        <p>Very few knew the name Sister Jose Hobday when the community gathered the
                            next night to hear her speak about gratitude. But we fell in love. An
                            American Indian Roman Catholic sister with an outrageous sense of humor,
                            Sister Jose, 76, had recently fallen, breaking an arm and bruising her ribs
                            and &lsquo;tailbone.&rsquo; Counseled to stay at home, she said she could be
                            miserable and stay at home, or miserable and come to the conference, so she
                            couldn&rsquo;t see any good reason to stay at home. Her stories brought
                            tears, punctuated with hilarity and even cheering, as she unpacked the often
                            neglected, powerful gift of thanks.</p>
                        <p>At the final banquet, graciously prepared and hosted by readers of the
                            Urantia Book, Dirk Ficca of the Council for the Parliament of the Worlds
                            Religions spoke from a prophetic stance. He wondered why the aggregate
                            religious community in the United States is unable to mobilize itself against
                            an ill-conceived and unjust war, unable to halt environmental degradation in
                            our own backyard, unable to make a significant difference in opposing
                            poverty. As his speech developed, and during a panel response, the
                            evening&rsquo;s theme became resolute hope in the midst of darkness.</p>
                        <p>Dirk&rsquo;s speech troubled some in the group, still flush with the high
                            energy and richness of the four days just shared. It seemed incongruous in an
                            arena where up-front politics is particularly uncomfortable for some
                            traditions. But the observations of at least three Canadian participants
                            tempered that evaluation, at least for this participant.</p>
                        <p>In their own gentle way, these Canadian brothers expressed relief that an
                            interfaith leader from the host nation of this event is finally calling the
                            current administration to account. &ldquo;How can we, as religious people,
                            neglect talking about these matters,&rdquo; asked one, &ldquo;if we care
                            about overcoming poverty and healing the earth and making peace?&rdquo; In
                            the e-mail discussions which followed the conference, Kay Lindahl, a leader
                            with both sponsors of the conference &ndash; NAIN (North America Interfaith
                            Network) and URI (United Religions Initiative-North America) &ndash; wrote,
                            &ldquo;the burning question for interfaith these days &ndash; how do we speak
                            as a moral voice in the world?&rdquo;</p>
                        <h2>The complexity of spiritual relationships</h2>
                        <p>The conference&rsquo;s spiritual context grounded and inspired the
                            dialogue and relationship-building. It was developed through multiple,
                            voluntarily attended expressions of&nbsp; prayer, meditation, ceremony, and
                            ritual led by different traditions, a &ldquo;Spiritual Immersion,&rdquo; as
                            host chair Gard Jameson put it. Muslim Friday Prayers, a Jewish Shabbat
                            service, and a Christian Eucharist were part of a much longer list of events,
                            including various indigenous ceremonies.</p>
                        <p>These sessions were comforting and meaningful to most, though troubling to
                            some. At least one participant noted that his constituency of more
                            conservative religious leaders would disappear in a flash with shared
                            religious practice. Others acknowledged that some of the shared ritual
                            stretched them and would be difficult &lsquo;back at home.&rsquo;</p>
                        <p>At one evaluation session, shared practice was affirmed with the caveat
                            that sensitivities, protocols, guidelines, and learnings regarding the matter
                            deserve more reflection and discussion as future events are planned.
                            Blessings before meals were appreciated. At the same time, members of the
                            young adult caucus suggested that discussing the distinction between
                            pluralism and syncretism is overdue in the interfaith movement.</p>
                        <h2>Who came?</h2>
                        <p>The remarkable content and the yeasty differences of opinion at
                            NAIN/URI-NA 2006 in part came from a partnership among interfaith leaders
                            from Las Vegas, from NAIN, and from URI-NA. They are grassroots networks that
                            had never joined hands in a convocation before; like-minded strangers from
                            across the continent met in Las Vegas and quickly became friends.</p>
                        <p>In addition, leaders came from major organizations such as the Council for
                            a Parliament of the Worlds Religions, the Interfaith Alliance, Interfaith
                            Youth Core, Religions for Peace&ndash;USA, Temple of Understanding, and
                            URI&rsquo;s Global Council, altogether an unprecedented set of connections.
                            Twenty of 140 participants were 35 years old or younger, mostly newcomers,
                            adding imagination, new energy, and provocative questions. Dozens of
                            individuals across the continent volunteered in the planning, making the
                            whole effort a collaborative, capacity-building exercise.</p>
                        <p>NAIN holds annual &ldquo;connects&rdquo; and will be gathering again
                            <strong>June 23-27, 2006</strong>, in Vancouver, BC, to explore the theme of
                            <strong>peace</strong>. The interfaith conference will be held in conjunction
                            with Vancouver&rsquo;s World Peace Forum, expected to draw 7,000 people from
                            around the world with a passion for making peace. Put it on your
                            calendar!

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable
                    civilization, a global interfaith movement has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
