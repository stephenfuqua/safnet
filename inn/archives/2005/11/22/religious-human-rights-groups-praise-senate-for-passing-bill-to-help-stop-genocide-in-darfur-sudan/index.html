                                first wrote about</a> the Darfur genocide 14 months ago, we had some hope
                            that the governments of the world would have put a stop to the rape and
                            pillaging by this time. Sadly, this is far from the truth. U.N. Secretary
                            General Kofi Annan recently wrote, &quot;The looming threat of complete
                            lawlessness and anarchy draws nearer, particularly in western Darfur, as
                            warlords, bandits and militia groups grow more aggressive.&quot; More action
                            is needed, including continued diplomatic pressure and a further expanded
                            African Union presence in western Sudan. At long last, the United States
                            government is moving closer to supporting new measures; though approval by
                            the House of Representatives is still necessary, it is a major step forward
                            for the Senate to have passed its Darfur Peace and Accountability Act this
                            past week, as reported by the <a class="dead-link" title="This link is no longer available">Save Darfur

                        <p>Washington, DC - November 19, 2005 - The Save Darfur Coalition, an
                            alliance of 140 faith-based, humanitarian and human rights groups
                            representing 130 million Americans, today praised the Senate for passing the
                            Darfur Peace and Accountability Act (S. 1462) last night and urged leaders in
                            the House of Representatives to pass the bill in the strongest form
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>The Darfur Peace and Accountability Act, endorsed by the Save Darfur
                            Coalition, has 37 bipartisan cosponsors in the Senate and 107 in the House of
                            Representatives. Among its provisions, the bill authorizes additional U.S.
                            assistance to the African Union&rsquo;s peacekeeping force in Sudan, calls
                            for a new U.N. Security Council resolution concerning Darfur, and provides
                            for additional sanctions against the perpetrators of the genocide.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;The Senate has done its job, and now the House International
                            Relations Committee needs to do its part by sending a strong bill with real
                            teeth to the House floor for a vote.&rdquo; said Richard Cizik, Vice
                            President for Governmental Affairs for the National Association of
                            Evangelicals. &ldquo;Congress needs to pass legislation that provides
                            resources for African Union troops, consequences for the Sudanese government,
                            and directs the Administration to prioritize this fight.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>Since the conflict began in the Darfur region of Sudan in 2003, more than
                            400,000 people have died, 3.5 million have been driven into hunger and 2.5
                            million displaced due to violence, according to reports from the World Food
                            Program, the United Nations and Coalition for International Justice. There
                            has been a dramatic rise in violence in recent months, a resulting drop in
                            humanitarian aid due to security concerns, and the kidnapping of dozens of
                            international observers, including one American.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Now is the time for action. We need to use the moral, physical, and
                            economic strength of America to stop what the Bush Administration has already
                            deemed genocide,&rdquo; said Coalition Coordinator David Rubenstein.
                            &ldquo;As the situation worsens, the people of Darfur desperately need more
                            than just empty words from House members, they need action. We are grateful
                            to Senators Brownback and Corzine for sponsoring the bill, Senate Foreign
                            Relations Committee Chairman Lugar for discharging it out of his committee
                            with a positive recommendation, and Senate Majority Leader Frist for bringing
                            it to the floor.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable
                    civilization, a global interfaith movement has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by
                    focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
