                            world&#8217;s leading Jewish-Catholic interfaith experts who analyze the history and

                        <p> &quot;Nostra Aetate demonstrates that the Church can look at its teachings and behaviors
                            towards Jews and Judaism, question them, challenge them and change them, said Abraham H.
                            Foxman, ADL National Director, and Rabbi Gary M. Bretton-Granatoor, ADL Director of
                            Interfaith Affairs.</p>
                        <p> &quot;The past forty years must be understood as our introduction to each other&#8217;s
                            community. We have learned to become comfortable with one another. We have shared the things
                            that we have in common and demonstrated positive changes are possible if there are willing
                            partners to enter into a dialogue.&quot;</p>
                        <p> Nostra Aetate, Latin for &quot;In Our Time&quot; was adopted by the Second Vatican Council
                            on October 28, 1965 and revolutionized the Catholic Church&#8217;s approach to Jews and
                            Judaism after nearly 2000 years of persecution by repudiating the &quot;deicide&quot; charge
                            against Jews, dismissing church interest in converting Jews, and reaffirming the eternal
                            covenant between God and the Jewish people.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable
                    civilization, a global interfaith movement has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
