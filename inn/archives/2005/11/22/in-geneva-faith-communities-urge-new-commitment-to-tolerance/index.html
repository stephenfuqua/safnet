                            be a source or fuel of conflict. And as many Western societies struggle to adapt to an

                        <p>Geneva &#8212; 11/15/2005 (<a href="http://www.wcc-coe.org/">WCC</a>) Whether in European
                            suburbs or Middle Eastern capitals, religious identity
                            can often seem to be a source or fuel of conflict. And as many Western
                            societies struggle to adapt to an emerging multicultural and multireligious reality, issues
                            of tolerance and &quot;living together&quot; become ever more
                            acute.</p>
                        <p>Responding to these concerns, people from virtually all the world&#8217;s faith
                            traditions came together in Geneva this week and appealed to their own
                            believers and the broader world to nurture actively the sources of
                            tolerance and compassion common to all religions.</p>
                        <p>&quot;We affirm that humankind, made up of many peoples, nations, races,
                            colours, cultures and religious traditions, is one human family. Therefore
                            we reject all attempts to drive wedges between religious traditions by
                            presenting them as mutually exclusive. We commit ourselves to lift up the
                            teachings and practices in our religious traditions that nourish life and
                            promote community,&quot; affirmed a statement of &quot;common commitments&quot; sent to
                            religious communities in Geneva and the region.</p>
                        <p>&quot;We call upon all religious communities to make such acts of commitment
                            their own and so further the vision of spirituality that would bring
                            healing and wholeness to our fractured world.&quot;</p>
                        <h2>Interfaith celebration</h2>
                        <p>The text was made public during a series of events focusing on religious
                            tolerance and dialogue on the theme &quot;My neighbour&#8217;s faith and mine:
                            religious identity - for better or for worse?&quot; in Geneva 12-14 November
                            2005, under the auspices of the World Council of Churches and the
                            Geneva-based Interreligious Platform.</p>
                        <p>Through encounter, debate, prayer and sacred dance, participants from
                            diverse religious horizons and origins shared their traditions, explored
                            the role of faith in their lives and how it influenced societies and
                            attitudes to &quot;the other&quot;.</p>
                        <p>The programme, including an inter-faith celebration at Geneva&#8217;s historic
                            St Pierre&#8217;s Cathedral, involved local leaders, scholars and other
                            participants from the Baha&#8217;i, Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jewish and
                            Muslim faiths. Highlights of the three-day event included an international
                            colloquium under the heading &quot;An end to tolerance?&quot;, and a youth forum
                            which allowed over 100 young people from 19 countries to dialogue on
                            experiences of belief, identity and plurality.</p>
                        <h2>Changes in religious identity</h2>
                        <p>Profound changes in society are strongly impacting the nature of religious
                            identity, according to Rev. Jean-Claude Basset, a Swiss Protestant pastor
                            and specialist on interreligious dialogue. In his context, faith could no
                            longer be considered as an inherited or imposed set of values, but was
                            increasingly understood as a question of individual conscience and
                            personal experience. Dialogue therefore requires new approaches.</p>
                        <p>For other speakers during the event, the fragmentation of traditional
                            identities, strengthened by globalization, is one of the root causes of
                            fundamentalism and an obstacle to dialogue, strengthening religious
                            &quot;fortresses&quot; and the risk of confrontation which, in some contexts,
                            already exists.</p>
                        <h2>Spirituality as a response to fundamentalism</h2>
                        <p>The problem of violence is not a problem of religion, but rather a problem
                            of our attitudes to religion, the Algerian-born Muslim academic Larbi
                            Kechat argued. &quot;We need to rediscover the connection between our vertical
                            and horizontal identities, the Divine and the human, which can be the
                            basis for rediscovering our mutuality and complementarity. The crisis
                            facing humankind is the loss of certitudes,&quot; which can lead to new forms
                            of religious fundamentalism, he said.</p>
                        <p>When religion becomes ideology, it has the capacity to nurture exclusivity
                            and therefore violence, according to Rabbi Marc Rapha&euml;l Guedj from
                            Geneva. &quot;There is a need to move from identity to spirituality. It is by
                            deepening spiritual experience, and returning to the sources of faith,
                            that a balanced relationship between particular identity and universality
                            can be restored,&quot; Guedj proposed. &quot;The deeper our religious experience,
                            the more open we become. Mystics of all traditions have no problem with
                            dialogue!&quot;</p>
                        <h2>From mutual understanding to active collaboration</h2>
                        <p>WCC&#8217;s general secretary, Rev. Dr Samuel Kobia, underlined how interfaith
                            dialogue is of growing significance for the WCC as a global fellowship of
                            Christian churches. &quot;Today the call for dialogue as a way of resolving
                            conflict, as a way of soothing tensions, and as a way of offering a space
                            where divisive issues could be discussed, is heard ever more loudly.
                            Religious leaders are being challenged to more effectively exercise their
                            ethical responsibility in addressing situations which could threaten peace
                            and coexistence.&quot;</p>
                        <p>&quot;The challenge to all religious communities is to re-imagine and rethink a
                            society that is able to cope constructively with religious and cultural
                            plurality,&quot; added Rev. Dr Hans Ucko, head of WCC&#8217;s interreligious
                            relations office, who moderated the international colloquium. &quot;There is an
                            urgent need to move beyond a situation of parallel societies to one that
                            is able to cope constructively with religious and cultural plurality,
                            going beyond mere tolerance to a community of authentic respect.&quot;</p>
                        <p>Dialogue needs to move from mutual understanding to active collaboration,
                            Kobia stressed. &quot;The increased awareness of religious plurality, the
                            potential role of religion in peace-building, and the growing recognition
                            of the place of religion in public life present immense challenges that
                            require deeper understanding and inter-faith cooperation. That which we
                            can do together, we should not do separately.&quot;</p>
                        <p>The interreligious event &quot;My neighbour&#8217;s faith and mine: religious
                            identity - for better or for worse?&quot; was made possible with the support of
                            Pictet &amp; Cie.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable

                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
