                    <div class="entry">
                        <p>Mr Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen may I add my welcome, to that already expressed, to all of
                            you and my congratulations to John Harrison and the young adults from Blackburn on their
                            production of the splendid exhibition &ldquo;Spirit of Blackburn with Darwen&rdquo;. This
                            exhibition has been evaluated by the Centre for Local Economic Strategies &ndash; a piece of
                            work we await with some expectation. It will not all make easy reading but it will guide the
                            Trustees as they seek to roll this work out across seventeen other communities in the North.
                            We have learnt a lot in this pilot project and when the work starts in Burnley next month we
                            will be much wiser. </p>
                        <p>May I ask you to look with me at the story of URI UK over the last seven years? In 1998 we
                            hosted a three day conference at Saint George&rsquo;s House Windsor. Our purpose was to
                            listen to Faith Leaders and Politicians and those already committed to Inter Faith work in
                            this country and find out if and how we might make an appropriate contribution to this. We
                            were encouraged to set up a nation-wide network of projects &ndash; practical grass roots
                            projects &ndash; working with young people of all the faiths.</p>
                        <p>On the 14th August 2000 we launched URI UK at a grand ceremony in the Millennium Dome. We
                            received encouragement from the Prime Minister, the Mayor of London and we received the
                            Blessings of representatives of all the Faiths. Two young people &ndash; one a Muslim the
                            other a Christian &ndash; spoke and encouraged us in this work.</p>
                        <p>There followed a period of reflection, of research and of networking &ndash; many meetings,
                            many conferences and some pilot projects to test the water and try our hand at this
                            difficult and sensitive work. We began to see that the Arts, Sacred Space and Education
                            might be the routes for us to deliver a significant contribution</p>
                        <p>In 2003 the Trustees commissioned The Beales Report. We were greatly encouraged by this. Our
                            plans seemed to fit national strategies and were both appropriate and urgently needed</p>
                        <p>In 2004 the Trustees wrote a Five Year Business Plan &ndash; a substantial document which
                            suggested we needed four hundred and nineteen thousand pounds for each of the next five
                            years to establish URI UK as a useful and pertinent network throughout England and Wales.
                        </p>
                        <p>Throughout this developmental period we continued to run Regional Conferences and to be
                            involved with others in learning to understand what was actually happening in the grass
                            roots communities. During these consultations, encounters and conferences we thought the
                            best way to start would be &ndash; Spirit of the North. This would draw together the three
                            strands of our work right across the North of England. The three stands are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>18 Photographic/Arts projects pulling together civic, faith and educational leaders.
                                Spirit of Blackburn is the pilot for this piece of work. It enables young adults to work
                                together, to create and to honour those from different spiritual backgrounds who make a
                                significant contribution to the economic and community life of their town. This is
                                innovative, dynamic and unique in its approach to community cohesion in communities
                                which are at risk of religious conflict.</li>
                            <li>The second strand of Spirit of the North is vitally important &ndash; it concerns Shared
                                Sacred Space. We all know that Religions have buildings or Space. We all know that these
                                are very precious to the adherents and that they hold something of the mystery and
                                wonder, something of the eternal within this earthly order. They are holy places and
                                they are a focus of peace and hope and fellowship. We also know that in this naughty
                                world they become the focus of conflict, anger and serious community division. In
                                Cheetham Hill, Manchester we have been offered twelve square meters of ground in a
                                building and we have found leaders of the Sikh, Jewish, Christian and Muslim Communities
                                who are prepared to work together to develop this as Shared Sacred Space - a very
                                important exercise. Working with the Forestry Commission we are identifying three areas
                                of fifty hectares (in the three Regions: NE, NW, Yorkshire and Humberside) which can be
                                owned by a company made up of 100 different congregations (again from all the faiths)
                                and developed as Shared Sacred Space. Such sites might be used for celebration, shared
                                prayer for Peace, Education and for a shared and joint statement by the Faith
                                Communities about the Environment. This is where our five year discussion about
                                providing a Peace Centre has led us. When I was recently visiting some North American
                                Indians I joined in a celebration of harvest. After the ceremonies and as I was bidden
                                farewell the leader said &ldquo;Walk gently upon blessed mother, you came from her, she
                                will sustain you and you will return to her, Malcolm, walk gently upon blessed Mother
                                Earth&rdquo;. In an age with a particular concern for the Environment the Faith Groups
                                might stand together in this land and begin to proclaim the sacred nature of all
                                creation.
                            </li>
                            <li>Together with our commitment to the Arts and Sacred Space comes our commitment to
                                conversation and meeting both across the faith groups and across the gender and
                                generation boundaries. We have hosted meetings of about a hundred people in Newcastle,
                                Birmingham, Nottingham, Manchester, London, Cambridge and Oxford where fifty slightly
                                older people have met with fifty younger people. Our next such meeting is in the Palace
                                of Westminster on 6th December. Their conversation has been about their spiritual
                                journey and the results have been profound. John Battle has referred to each of these
                                conversations as being a brick in the building of our new society. We wish to host many
                                more such meeting right across the North of England.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>So that is where we have got to &ndash; these last seven years have been very exciting and
                            great fun - all totally new territory for me. It has cost money and the Home Office has
                            helped and many charities and individuals have supported us and I take this opportunity to
                            thank all of those who have given. Now this phase of our work, envisioning and planning, is
                            complete. We are as ready as we will ever be to roll this out across the North of England
                            and later, hopefully, throughout the country. The Spirit of the North will enrich work
                            currently being done, will encourage new people to involve themselves in this work and will
                            network both statutory and voluntary practical projects together in an encouraging and
                            liberating way. It will involve young people.</p>
                        <p>We are looking for the day when Faith Groups stop just looking for their own space and
                            privileges and begin to stand together to help this nation to recognise the spiritual nature
                            of creation and of every living person &ndash; the environment is an ever demanding sphere
                            for our joint work.</p>
                        <p>So what we have developed over the last seven years is now ready for delivery. We believe
                            Arts/Photography, Sacred Space and talking across the generation, gender and faith
                            boundaries are the way. We are ready to do it. We believe the projects are appropriate and
                            practical. We believe it is possible &ndash; we may be slightly in front of the game, but if
                            we lay the foundations now , this will serve the nation well for the next hundred or so
                            years. It is ground-breaking work, just in front of need, so it needs imaginative, creative
                            people to fund it. This would be a good gift to give to your children and your
                            children&rsquo;s children. If we find the funding now to establish the network we believe
                            that in the future funding will come from local and regional pots. But we need national
                            funding to get over the hill and lay out the foundations. We need two hundred and fifty
                            thousand pounds for each of the next three years to establish this. We need to make it quite
                            clear this is not establishing a new religion it is building a series of bridges. We need to
                            say this is not about serving faith groups but about the part faith groups can play in
                            National and local community cohesion. We passionately believe religion, spirituality, faith
                            &ndash; call it what you will &ndash; is the vital key to such cohesion. It has been in the
                            past and it will be in the future &ndash; the alternative is too terrible to contemplate. In
                            many communities the peace is very fragile &ndash; it could go either way.</p>
                        <p>I lay this before you. We have done our work. We are ready to do our best in the next phase
                            of all of this &ndash; but until the funding can be found we shall have to place all our
                            plans and dreams on the back burner.</p>
                        <p>Mr Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I leave it with you.</p>
                        <p>Thank you.</p>

                            of collaboration in action, which should be the primordeal aim of whatever interreligious
                            dialogue organisation. What happened to the original goals of the URI ? What about the world

                        <p>Greetings Reverend Malcolm Stonestreet, Lucien Cosyns, and Friends, respectively,</p>
                        <p>May Peace Be With You.</p>
                        <p>The article on the progression of United Religions Initiative in Britain is interesting. The
                            insight of the experiences, the lessons learned, and the objectives for the future are
                            valuable and appreciated. As can be expected, there is much similarity between the
                            InterFaith initiatives described in this article and InterFaith initiatives taking place in
                            other locations throughout the World, including here in the Great Lakes region of the
                            Western Hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>The notion of the Shared Sacred Spaces is particularly interesting. This notion is similar to
                            the specific initiative of this InterFaith Settlement. This InterFaith Settlement is an
                            intentional community that welcomes adherents of the respective religious traditions of the
                            World, including Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam. The function of this
                            InterFaith Settlement is to maintain a shared space, intrinsically sacred, that facilitates
                            daily and pragmatic interaction between the respective adherents of the respective religious
                            traditions of the World.</p>
                        <p>Lucien Cosyns, your consideration pertaining the maintenance of a global concentration is
                            appropriate. There was an interesting tendency within the speech, Reverend Malcolm
                            Stonestreet, to emphasise a British national identity to foster the progression of the
                            InterFaith initiative. And consequently there was an emphasis on the solicitation of money
                            to facilitate such progression. This is understandable, and the genuine efforts that you and
                            your colleagues with URI UK have made to progress the objective of InterFaith and
                            interreligious tolerance and understanding and Peace throughout the World and Universe are
                            appreciated. </p>
                        <p>It may be provided that there are additional means through which to make similar progression.
                            For example, one of the guiding principles affiliated with this InterFaith Settlement is to
                            abstain from holding or exchanging money. This may be compared to the prohibition practised
                            by certain Buddhist monks as well as the teaching of Jesus, ‘Render unto Caesar that which
                            belongs to Caesar and render unto God that which belongs to God.’ The practical benefit of
                            this approach is a comparative perception of integrity in pursuing the communicated
                            objectives of this InterFaith Settlement and a comparably tangible and direct measurement of
                            the benefits provided to this InterFaith Settlement with the tangible as well as intrinsic
                            (or intangible) benefits provided by this InterFaith Settlement.</p>
                        <p>Lucien Cosyns, the website that you offer is rather interesting. The provision of the
                            resources and the cooperation that is provided through your website are appreciated.</p>
                        <p>On a side note, I may provide that the ‘hotmail’ email account that has been previously
                            utilised in conjunction with this InterFaith Settlement has been closed by Microsoft
                            Networks, though interestingly enough, the web log service provided by Microsoft Networks
                            remains functional.</p>
                        <p>With humble and benevolent regards,</p>
                        <p>Peter F Womack</p>
                        <p>Peace belongs throughout the Universe.</p>
                        <p>All Praise Belongs To God.

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable
                    civilization, a global interfaith movement has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
