                            Living, Brahmakumaris, Ramakrishna Mission, Sant Nirankari Mandal, Diocese of Agra and

                            connectedness on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
                        </p>
                        <p>The MDGs translate human development into simple and meaningful objectives; they go right to
                            the heart of improving lives of people and address some of the most enduring problems of
                            human<br />
                            suffering. More importantly, they are achievable goals, dependant only upon political will
                            and citizen&#8217;s determination. In substance, they constitute an agenda for eradicating
                            poverty - human poverty not just income poverty - in the world.</p>
                        <p>Faith leaders and faith based organisations have always been part of global solutions for
                            human suffering. They have demonstrated their love and compassion through education and
                            health initiatives. Innovations such as telemedicine in health and ICT in education have
                            linked this deprived community to world.</p>
                        <p>Global experience tells us that faith organizations also have tremendous potential to play a
                            critical role in partnerships and coalitions that are needed to confront even greater issues
                            related to human sufferings. For instance Uganda, Thailand and Senegal, are three countries
                            that have witnessed their courageous and effective efforts related to HIV/AIDS.</p>
                        <h2>OneWorld Seminar for Faith Based Partnerships</h2>
                        <p>Today, with knowledge forming a central vehicle in the creation of a poverty free world,
                            there is a need to harness the power of communication between stakeholders, to enhance
                            partnerships for progress towards the Millennium Development Goals. Therefore, OneWorld
                            South Asia organized a one-day seminar in New Delhi, on November 10, 2005, with the
                            following objectives:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To communicate with one another about what different FBOs are doing.</li>
                            <li> To learn form one another about new ways of reaching out to the disadvantaged and
                                deprived.</li>
                            <li> To explore the formation of faith-based Communities of Practice (CoP) and networks as a
                                platform for working towards common objectives related to the MDGs.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In his welcoming remarks, Dr. Shadrach, director of OneWorld South Asia shared a message from
                            Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, who saw the seminar as an encouraging step towards realizing the
                            vision of Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam, meaning One World Family. Sri Sri Ravi Shankar lauded the
                            initiative to bring different groups together for a common cause and stressed that the key
                            challenge was to nurture the self-esteem of human beings, thus empowering them in dealing
                            with issues closest to their lives.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Shadrach also pointed out that religious organizations had been working for upliftment of
                            people and their self esteem for almost four thousand years. &#8216;Their contribution goes
                            beyond spiritual awakening - very often they addressed issues of people&#8217;s material
                            needs as well as those of social reform,&#8217; he said.</p>
                        <p>Rev. CB Samuel, Chairman, Micah Challenge India (an Evangelical Christian Alliance on MDGs)
                            provided an overview of the MDGs in the context of FBOs. &#8216;Although historically, faith
                            based organizations have not always been reputed for efforts in poverty alleviation and
                            empowerment, I am happy to note that this has changed. Today there is much more openness to
                            dialogue with and among FBOs for meaningful partnerships in meeting the MDGs&#8217; he said.
                        </p>
                        <p>Speaking about the MDGs, Rev.Samuel added, &#8216;these are actually Minimum Development
                            Goals. The concept of halving infant mortality by 2015 means that where we have 30,000
                            children of the world dying every day, we work towards a situation where 15,000 children
                            will die! If we, who are from the religious community, believe that life is from God, then
                            each life is important.&#8217;</p>
                        <p>Elucidating that religious agencies, having always provided much needed succor to people, now
                            need to advocate their unique analysis of poverty and development, Rev Samuel said,
                            &#8216;So far governments and economists have looked at development as a material activity.
                            FBOs should stress that persons are more than material.&#8217;</p>
                        <p>&#8216;Our interventions need to be rooted in the ground realities and basic needs of the
                            people. When we set up hospitals we need to ensure that healthcare reaches the poorest of
                            the poor. When we educate, we need to ensure that education addresses the knowledge and
                            learning needs of children.&#8217;</p>
                        <p>The seminar, with representation from different sections of Bahai, Buddhist, Christian,
                            Hindu, Parsi and Sikh religions, was replete with exciting and varying philosophies,
                            approaches and programmers for support and development of grassroots communities.</p>
                        <p>Several commonalities emerged in the sharing that followed - there was a common belief in the
                            innate nobility and dignity of human beings, the need to educate children in the mind and
                            spirit to prepare them for a worthy life, the need to mobilize communities, not just
                            individuals, and to share one&#8217;s material possessions, talents and capacities in the
                            service of God and humanity.</p>
                        <p>It was evident that these organizations were involved in each and every area specified in the
                            MDGs, including poverty alleviation, education, empowerment of women and marginalized
                            communities, disaster relief, sustainable livelihoods, health, water and sanitation. It was
                            also felt that efforts at inter-faith harmony would bring everyone to a common platform of
                            co-operation for working to achieve the MDGs.</p>
                        <p>The meeting concluded with commitment to continue the dialogue that had been initiated by
                            OneWorld South Asia, and to form theme-based communities of practice that would facilitate
                            sharing of knowledge, best practices, resources, expertise and co-operative efforts to meet
                            the MDGs. OneWorld is convinced that the Faith Based Communities of Practice do have vital
                            contributions to make on each MDG and they look forward to facilitating partnerships and
                            initiatives that will enhance and support them.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable
                    civilization, a global interfaith movement has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
