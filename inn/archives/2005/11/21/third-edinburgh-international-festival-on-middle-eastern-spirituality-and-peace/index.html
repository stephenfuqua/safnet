                        <p>Professor Tariq Ramadan and Greek Orthodox Bishop Kallistos Ware will lead a field of
                            speakers, artists, writers and scholars in presenting the <a

                                Spirituality and Peace</a>, from 8 February to 12 March 2006, MESP 2006.</p>
                        <p>Professor Tariq Ramadan will give the 2006 Middle East Festival Lecture on &#8216;Islam and
                            the West in a Quest for a Just and Peaceful World&#8217;, and Bishop Kallistos Ware will
                            participate in the conference, Pathways of the Heart, and give the 2006 Middle East Festival
                            Conference Lecture, &#8216;Acquiring Inner Peace.&#8217; These follow on from the 2005
                            Middle East Festival Lecture which was given by the three times Nobel Peace Prize nominee,
                            Abuna Elias Chacour, on &#8216;Spiritual Approaches to Middle East Peace.&#8217;</p>
                        <p>Internationally distinguished musicians and artists participating in MESP 2006 will include
                            Yair Dalal, Omar Faruk Tekbilek, Davod Azad, Latif Bolat, Beth Bahia Cohen and Yasmin Levy.
                            Yair Dalal, composer, violinist and oud player is probably the most prolific Israeli ethnic
                            musician today. Omar Faruk Tekbilek is honoured as a peacemaker and virtuoso who brilliantly
                            interprets the Sufi, Folk, and Contemporary music of the Middle East. Davod Azad is an
                            accomplished multi-instrumentalist and vocalist mastering in the Iranian Classical music,
                            the Azeri folk music, the Ancient Persian music, and the Persian Sufi music. One of the most
                            distinguished Turkish musicians in the United States, Latif Bolat plays the folk and
                            spiritual music of Turkey on a traditional instrument called a baglama (saz). Beth Bahia
                            Cohen is a master of the violin and various bowed instruments from the Middle East and the
                            Balkans. In her deep, spiritual and moving style of singing, Yasmin Levy preserves and
                            revives the most beautiful and romantic songs from the Ladino/Judeo-Spanish heritage, mixing
                            it with Andalusian Flamenco.</p>
                        <p>The conference and Festival are non-political in nature taking no fixed position on any
                            political, ethical or cultural question. It intends rather to create a forum in which we can
                            listen to each other more deeply and learn with more open minds and hearts.</p>
                        <p>During the 1970s and 80s, some of the organizers were involved in the citizen diplomacy
                            movement that sought to bring citizens of the UK and USA in contact with citizens of the
                            USSR. As we discovered then, what we don&#8217;t yet know about each other may be much more
                            important than what we do know, or think we know. Citizen diplomacy created the context for
                            later political change. This diplomacy began when those who engaged in it were willing to
                            really meet the &ldquo;enemy,&rdquo; deliberately laying aside the preconceived ideas they
                            held of each other.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the history of the Middle Eastern spiritual traditions, the mystics and prophets
                            have often offered points of view contrary to the prevailing mainstream. From Meister
                            Eckhart and St John of the Cross in the Christian tradition to the Sufis al-Hallaj and
                            Suhrawardi in the Islamic to the historical prophets of the Hebrew bible, they have often
                            suffered for it. In modern times, prophets and mystics continue to offer their voices for
                            new, non-violent solutions to conflict, even when these opinions subjects them to criticism
                            or danger.</p>
                        <p>One of the purposes of MESP has been to show that a great range of opinion exists not only
                            between traditions but also within each. The idea that any one group or person can claim to
                            speak for the totality of any religion or spiritual tradition seems greatly outdated in a
                            multi-cultural society, and many scholars of religious studies or comparative spirituality
                            today prefer to speak, for instance, of multiple Christianities, Judaisms and Islams. The
                            media&#8217;s tendency to want to stereotype any particular tradition or religion or to
                            quote a single &ldquo;Christian,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jewish,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Islamic&rdquo;
                            opinion on any issue has often hampered more than helped religious and interreligious
                            understanding.</p>
                        <p>MESP seeks to engage a progressively wider and more diverse range of representatives who have
                            been working with spiritual tools in the fields of non-violent conflict resolution and world
                            peace. No speaker represents the totality of any tradition. Likewise, no religious group or
                            organization, or the MESP organization or sponsors, should be identified with the opinions
                            of any speaker, whose opinions remain his/her own. One of the primary principles of MESP is
                            that all mystical and prophetic voices for non-violence and peace should be allowed a
                            hearing, without censorship or prior vetting by any religious group or organization.</p>
                        <p>Many complex political and ethical issues face religious leaders and organizations today.
                            Speakers may hold various personal points of view on these subjects; however, we have asked
                            that they focus their talks and presentations on spirituality and spiritual approaches for
                            peace, as there are many other forums in which to discuss other, better known political and
                            ethical issues. </p>
                        <p>There were over eighty events in the Festival in 2005, an increase of at least three times
                            over the offerings of the 2004 Festival in terms of content. Spiritual practice was woven
                            into many Festival events to allow the spiritualities under consideration to be present to
                            direct experience. The Festival in 2006 will be even richer and more diverse with a
                            significant increase in events over the 2005 Festival.</p>
                        <p>The 2005 Festival included participation from Baha&#8217;i, Brahma Kumaris, several Buddhist
                            traditions, most of the Christian denominations in Scotland and some international Christian
                            traditions such as the Melkite Catholic Church, Druze (through the work of the Interfaith
                            Encounter Association), Hindu, Sunni and Shia Islam, Ismaili, Orthodox Judaism, Reform
                            Judaism, the Edinburgh Liberal Jewish Community, the Jewish Renewal Movement from USA,
                            Sikhism, several traditions of Sufism, Zoroastrianism, as well as representatives of
                            interfaith organisations and of further spiritual movements, such as the Dances of Universal
                            Peace, Whirling Dervishes, Mevlevi Tariqat, the World Peace Prayer Society, Subud (we had an
                            international delegation from Subud at the Festival), Sahaj Marg, Anthroposophy, Shamanism,
                            Goddess Spirituality, Paganism, Amma Spirituality, Radhasoami/Universal, Esoteric Christian,
                            Christian Healing, Sanatana Dharma, Gnostic, FFWPU and others, reflecting an impressive
                            spiritual diversity among the participants, which was further enriched by ethnic, cultural
                            and national diversities.</p>
                        <p>In MESP 2006 five strands to the Festival will be more explicit, to allow a range of entry
                            routes into the Festival, and to allow a range of participation identities, namely:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li> spirituality, and relations among spiritual traditions;</li>
                            <li> education and audience development;</li>
                            <li> arts and culture;</li>
                            <li> celebrating the diversity of Scotland and the UK;</li>
                            <li> celebrating Scotland and the UK in international terms.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>MESP 2006 presents an impressive range of events across these five strands, including
                            spiritual retreats, workshops and conferences; a wide range of education events, including
                            Persian and Arabic Calligraphy, and printmaking and sculpture workshops; a wide range of
                            spiritual and peace concerts; Middle Eastern percussion events; film series on Music of the
                            Middle East and peace films; events on spiritual movement and dance; photography and visual
                            arts exhibitions; poetry and theatre events on spiritual themes of the Middle East;
                            Mesopotamian storytelling; all women spiritual and cultural events and workshops;
                            community-led cultural events which celebrate Middle Eastern diversity within the wider
                            context of diversity in Scotland &ndash; including events with the Moroccan, Turkish,
                            Kurdish, Iranian, Iraqi, and Armenian communities; community hosted food events; services;
                            peace walks; multi faith and spiritual forums; scholarly lectures; book launch events; among
                            others, and all celebrating Scotland and the UK in international terms of reference. </p>
                        <p>As an example, Ulfah Arts is a pioneering organisation providing opportunities for women who
                            practice specific cultural beliefs to develop themselves across all art forms in the
                            environments and conditions they need - breaking down stereotypes, allowing greater
                            understanding and creating harmony which in Arabic is Ulfah. Ulfah Arts will be holding an
                            all women event during the 2006 Festival on Friday 24 February, The Journey to the Great
                            Mosaic, supported by Islamic Relief. The event will consist of a concert including poetry,
                            Islamic songs/Music (nasheeds), comedy and Quran recitation. A peace-fusion of women, art,
                            Islam and spirituality for ALL women to enjoy!</p>
                        <p>MESP is a celebration, and we look forward to welcoming guests to the Festival from across
                            the UK and further afield to enrich the conversations and the spiritual and cultural
                            exchange.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable
                    civilization, a global interfaith movement has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
