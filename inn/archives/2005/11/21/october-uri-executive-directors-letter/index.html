                        <p>Dear URI Friends,
                        </p>
                        <p>Greetings of love and peace.</p>
                        <p>I would like to share some reflections on the International Day of Peace observances I was
                            privileged to take part in. You can find stories of many other URI observances on our
                            website <a
                                href="http://www.uri.org/CC_News/Global_News/IDP2005.html">http://www.uri.org/CC_News/Global_News/IDP2005.html</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>World Peace Festival:
                            On September 18, I was in Amenia, NY for a wonderful peace festival hosted by the World
                            Peace Prayer Society under the leadership of their director, Deborah Moldow, who is also a
                            URI Global Council Trustee and convener of the URI UN CC. The festival was a powerful
                            experience that supported people&rsquo;s deep yearning for peace that rises from within each
                            of us and is manifested through our lives and our communities.</p>
                        <p>One highlight was an interfaith ceremony offering prayers for peace from many different
                            traditions. I find that these days whenever I am asked to offer a prayer or to speak I
                            begin, as I have for years, by extending greetings of love and peace from the URI community
                            around the world. Then I ask people to be mindful of the gift of life and to experience a
                            deep gratitude for the miracle and mystery of each breath we take, which connects us with
                            all live on this Earth. I ask people to experience gratitude that we are able to gather in
                            safety in a world where so many live each day in fear; to gather in the midst of abundance
                            when so many live each day hungry. And I ask people to invite into our midst our sisters and
                            brothers all over the world who may live in fear or hunger that they may join us in a time
                            of rest and renewal and that we may join them in a deeper commitment to work for a world
                            where all can live lives free from fear about their survival and free from hunger</p>
                        <p>The other highlight of the day was the World Peace Prayer Ceremony, which began with a
                            stirring message by Masami. Saionji, Chair of the World Peace Prayer Society, who invited
                            all present to live into the fullness of their divine nature as lights of peace. Following
                            her inspiring remarks, the flags of 191 nations and of communities of identity, such as
                            Tibet and Palestine and the native peoples of North America, which are not formally
                            recognized as nations, were paraded as those gathered prayed that the people of each nation
                            live in peace and that peace prevail on Earth. The ceremony was deeply moving and is, I
                            believe, a critically important tool in helping to create a global consciousness for peace.
                        </p>
                        <p>International Day of Peace:
                            Three days later, on September 21, I joined Monica Willard, URI&rsquo;s UN representative,
                            many members of the URI UN CC, UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, and Mrs. Annan, several UN
                            Messengers for Peace, including Elie Wiesel and Jane Goodall, and 500 young people to
                            observe the International Day of Peace at the UN. The URI is blessed with Monica&rsquo;s
                            leadership, and the UN has been blessed by all the work she has done over the years to build
                            a powerful observance of the IDP within the UN.</p>
                        <p>As he prepared to ring the Peace Bell, which was cast from coins donated by children all over
                            the world, the Secretary General reflected that this day is intended to grow into a day of
                            global ceasefire where all people all over the Earth step back from violence and reflect on
                            the practice of peace. He commented that people often say that 24 hours is not a very long
                            time to devote to the practice of peace, but 24 hours is, he said, a long enough time for
                            people to look across the barbed wire that separates them and ask what they might do to
                            remove the need for the barbed wire. Having stood recently with URI&rsquo;s Global Council
                            and staff and many Korean colleagues looking across the barbed wire of the Demilitarized
                            Zone in Korea, I have a heightened understanding of what Mr. Annan was talking about.</p>
                        <p>Following the ceremonial ringing of the bell in the UN&rsquo;s peace garden, the action
                            shifted to Conference Room 3 where 500 young people and a few selected adults (I was
                            privileged to be among that number representing URI), gathered to hear UN Undersecretary
                            General, Shashi Tharoor, Mrs. Nane Annan and several of the Ambassadors for Peace. The first
                            two speakers read from entries about peace that had been submitted to the UN by young people
                            from all over the world and can be found at www.un.org/Pubs/CyberSchoolBus/.</p>
                        <p>Elie Wiesel asked why we celebrate war and not peace. He said there is nothing beautiful or
                            glorious about war. It is ugly and grotesque. Both sides suffer in war. It is time we found
                            the words and the will to make peace seem more glorious than war, he said. Then he offered a
                            gentle but clear challenge to the young people, It&rsquo;s up to you to make sure that my
                            past does not become your future.</p>
                        <p>A highlight of the program was the link, by internet video streaming, with young people in
                            the Middle East and in Northern Ireland. The young people from Israel attend the Bridge Over
                            the Wadi School where Jewish and Arab children study side by side. The school was founded in
                            the midst of so much despair and violence by parents who believed it was their duty to give
                            their children the opportunity to grow up differently, to create an experiential foundation
                            upon which to build a better world. Based on the comments from the students, this noble
                            experiment is working.</p>
                        <p>The young people from Northern Ireland attended the Hazelwood College (a high school) in
                            Belfast where Protestant and Catholic young people study side by side. I was deeply
                            impressed by the leadership of these young people, especially the young women, as they spoke
                            of the power for transformation that comes with this sort of schooling. One person
                            commented, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Protestant and I had never met a Catholic before coming here.
                            Now I know many Catholics and I love them all very much. They&rsquo;re my best
                            friends.&rdquo; Another remarked, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to do what our fathers and
                            uncles did before us, we&rsquo;re going to break out of the mold.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>After an internet facilitated interaction with students from these schools, we heard from
                            several young activists who are committed to inspiring and practical projects of
                            transformation. One of the most stirring moments came when a young Israeli Jew, Yaakov
                            &ldquo;Kofy&rdquo; Sadan, spoke of his experience in Seeds of Peace, a program that brings
                            Jewish and Arab young people together to live and learn with and from each other in the US.
                            Kofy spoke of how he hadn&rsquo;t known that he would have to work so closely with Arab
                            young people and sleep in the same room with them. He was terrified when, having grown up
                            with the warning to never turn your back on an Arab or you&rsquo;ll be stabbed in the back,
                            he suddenly realized that he was to sleep with a Jordanian on one side of him and a
                            Palestinian on the other side. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t sleep much that night because I was so
                            afraid,&rdquo; he said. But his fear passed as he came to realize that the &ldquo;other
                            side&rdquo; are just human beings. He acknowledged that the conflict is complex, that peace
                            is hard work and will take a long time, but he was clear that peace was much more possible
                            because the seeds of peace were planted, a conviction shared by his Palestinian colleague,
                            Ahmad Mamdouh Medhat.</p>
                        <p>Following these presentations, we participated in the World Peace Prayer Ceremony, led by
                            Deborah Moldow. The ceremony began with the ringing of a peace bell forged from metal
                            reclaimed from weapons. Nane Annan was invited to ring the bell on behalf of the nations of
                            the world. I was honored to join her, on behalf of URI, representing the world&rsquo;s
                            religions. As it had two days before, this ceremony created a powerful field of prayer and
                            global consciousness for peace.</p>
                        <p>Our next stop was across the street from the UN at the Isaiah Wall, so named because it bears
                            the famous quotation from the prophet Isaiah, &ldquo;They shall beat their swords into
                            plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation shall not lift up sword against
                            nation. Neither shall they learn war any more.&rdquo; Joining with Heidi Kuhn, founder of
                            Roots of Peace, we participated in a ceremonial planting of a grapevine, celebrating her
                            organization&rsquo;s removal of 100,000 landmines in Afghanistan and the harvesting of
                            80,000 tons of table grapes from the newly freed fields.</p>
                        <p>Finally, we journeyed to the lower end of Manhattan near the site of the World Trade Center
                            to St. Peter&rsquo;s Catholic Church, which, with St. Paul&rsquo;s Episcopal Chapel, served
                            as centers of spiritual support in the horrifying and yet hopeful days following the
                            September 11 attacks. Fr. Lyndon Harris, who led the ministry of St. Paul&rsquo;s Chapel,
                            urged those gathered to focus not on September 11, but on September 12, which marked an
                            extraordinary coming together of countless people from all cultures, races, religions and
                            walks of life to begin to build a new tomorrow out of the smoldering ashes of yesterday. He
                            spoke compellingly of the need to plant gardens of forgiveness all over the world, not to
                            excuse the evil that has been done, but to create visible expressions of our need to move
                            from the experience of that evil into a different life based not on retribution but on
                            transformation.</p>
                        <p>Marianne Williamson spoke eloquently about the human connection with the divine. She
                            challenged all present to commit ourselves to the spiritual practices that will allow us
                            increasingly to manifest the divine qualities of love, compassion and peace within ourselves
                            and through our actions in the world for the good of all.</p>
                        <p>Following Marianne&rsquo;s remarks, Deborah Moldow, for the second time that day, led a World
                            Peace Prayer Ceremony. It was thrilling, in this church whose roof had been pierced by a
                            piece of metal during the collapse of the Trade Towers, to see the flags of all the
                            world&rsquo;s nations waving, each distinct and beautiful, and together creating an
                            inspiring whole that celebrated our distinctness and uplifted our underlying unity.</p>
                        <p>Having been given the honor, on behalf of URI, to offer the closing prayer, I noted that
                            members of URI all over the world were joining with us in observing the International Day of
                            Peace, and I commented that our prayers for all the nations of the world had filled the
                            church with over 6 billion people &ndash; in that moment we were one. One not only with
                            those we loved easily, but with those we didn&rsquo;t like and may have found it
                            excruciatingly hard to love. I prayed that we be guided in our work to see divine love
                            manifest within us and through us as we lived into our call to be light to the world.</p>
                        <p>It is a joy and a privilege to share this journey with you. Let us, together, be light to the
                            world.</p>
                        <p>Love,<br />

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable
                    civilization, a global interfaith movement has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
