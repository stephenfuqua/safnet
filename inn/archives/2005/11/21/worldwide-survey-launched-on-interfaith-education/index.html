                        <p> HARTFORD, CT (October 19, 2005) &#8212; Learning about, from and with peoples of other
                            faiths is increasingly being recognized as a vital aspect of education in faith communities
                            and education systems. A newly launched web-based survey on interfaith education aims to
                            discover examples of good practice across the world. </p>
                        <p>The World Council of Churches&#8217; Education and Ecumenical Formation program and Hartford
                            Seminary, USA, have created the interactive survey on interfaith education to catalogue what
                            is taking place in international communities. The survey is part of the larger Interfaith
                            Education Project (IEP) sponsored by the two organizations.</p>
                        <p>Taking seriously the diversity of religious faith and practice to build positive
                            understanding and attitudes, the IEP is a contribution to reflection and action on education
                            in the ecumenical movement. The project has two objectives - (1) to survey and analyze the
                            global field of interfaith education; (2) to produce a resource based on the results of that
                            survey which would assist educators in faith communities and education systems develop
                            interfaith education appropriate to their context.</p>
                        <p>Project Coordinator Christy Lohr said, &quot;The IEP is a noteworthy endeavor that recognizes
                            the importance of religious diversity around us today. The launch of the survey is really
                            exciting as it provides a means for individuals from around the world to be involved and
                            provide input on ways to shape future resources to support educational outreach.&quot;</p>
                        <p>Ms. Lohr, along with Heidi Hadsell, president of Hartford Seminary and members of the EEF
                            Commission, will discuss initial findings of the survey in a workshop during the World
                            Council of Church&#8217;s 9th Assembly in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in February.</p>
                        <p>Both Hartford Seminary and the World Council of Churches have a long history in fostering
                            quality interfaith relations. Hartford Seminary is a non-denominational graduate-level
                            theological educational institution that is committed the understanding of religion and
                            spirituality as they are played lived out in today&#8217;s multifaith world. With a strong
                            program in Christian-Muslim relations, it is also the only Christian seminary in the United
                            States to offer an Islamic chaplaincy certification.</p>
                        <p>The WCC brings together more than 340 churches, denominations and church fellowships in more
                            than 100 countries and territories throughout the world, representing 400 million Christians
                            and including most of the world&#8217;s Orthodox churches and denominations.

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable
                    civilization, a global interfaith movement has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
