                        <p>Amidst tensions surrounding the days-old murder of a Shiite religious
                            leader in this multi-religious, but Sunni-dominated nation, a peace pole was
                            planted in Pakistan&#39;s second largest city, Lahore, on January 15th.
                            Planted near the Pakistan Day Memorial, it was a small but hopefully
                            significant further step in efforts to bring the religions of Pakistan into
                            greater harmony and goodwill. May peace prevail in Pakistan, may peace
                            prevail on Earth.</p>

            <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable
                civilization, a global interfaith movement has sprung from the

                by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
                and resources.</p>
