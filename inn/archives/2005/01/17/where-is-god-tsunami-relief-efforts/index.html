                    <p class="postdate">January 17th, 2005</p>
                    <div class="entry">
                        <p><a id="more-9"></a>
                        <p>When a 9.0 magnitude earthquake off Indonesia sent gigantic waves crashing
                            down on hundreds of thousands of hapless souls, countless people around the
                            world asked: where is God? Touching on an ancient question that has plagued
                            monotheistic believers through the ages, people wanted to know how their God
                            could allow such horror to afflict innumerable innocent individuals in some
                            of the poorest areas of the world. Nearly 170,000 are known to have died.
                            Thousands of villages, fishing boats, places of worship, farms &ndash;
                            decimated. Colin Powell remarked that it was worse than a war zone.
                            We&rsquo;ve seen the images and heard the tales of woe &ndash; and where was
                            God?</p>
                        <p>I cannot speak for anyone else&rsquo;s conception of God &ndash; but on
                            January 8th I knew my answer. God was at the Jami Masjid in Las Vegas, where
                            I attended a fundraiser at which the Islamic Society of Nevada announced it
                            had raised over &#x0024;70,000 for charities on the ground in South Asia (by the
                            way, the crowd consisted of a few hundred Muslims as well as a couple of
                            Christians, Buddhists, Hindus, and one Baha&rsquo;i). The universal spirit of
                            consciousness that I sometimes call &ldquo;God&rdquo; was with the Vancouver
                            Buddhists that decided to sell their temple in order to send half a million
                            dollars (Canadian) to the unfortunate recipients of Mother Nature&rsquo;s
                            blind movements.</p>
                        <p>God was most certainly with the dozens of major Christian groups who
                            broadened their often praiseworthy humanitarian work &ndash; and raised
                            millions of dollars &ndash; to include all of the affected lands. The Holy
                            Spirit, the Buddha-nature, Allah, Brahman &ndash; something deeper than the
                            everyday physical reality of mankind &ndash; was at work when one nation
                            after another pledged billions of dollars for the short and long term relief
                            efforts. The list of groups religious, a-religious, and probably even
                            irreligious who have contributed to the humanitarian relief is too long to
                            even begin mentioning names.</p>
                        <p>Often my rational mind questions what I mean when I
                            say, &ldquo;I believe in God.&rdquo; Sometimes I am even convinced that I do
                            not &ndash; but oddly enough this horrendous disaster has helped stem that
                            tide of internal questioning. I may not understand what God is; what I do
                            intellectualize is far different from what I once envisioned. But I do know
                            Something is there, beyond my grasp, but leading mankind to compassion and
                            noble deeds. A rabbi at

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable
                    civilization, a global interfaith movement has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
