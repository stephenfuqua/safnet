                        <p>&#8220;From Monday 14 February - Sunday 6 March 2005 the 2nd Annual Edinburgh Festival of
                            Middle Eastern Spirituality and Peace will bring together artists, scholars, grassroots
                            spiritual activists, and speakers from the Sufi, Druze, Baha&#8217;i, Ismaili, Zoroastrian
                            and other lesser known spiritual traditions, in addition to representatives of Judaism,

                        <p>Perhaps you too are thinking: why, oh why, an event on &quot;Middle
                            Eastern Spirituality and Peace&quot; (MESP) in Scotland of all places? There
                            may not be a better answer than that this is where the people who wish to
                            hold it already are; nevertheless it looks to be an impressive event coming
                            later this spring.</p>
                        <p>Running from February 14th through March 6, the <em>Edinburgh
                                International Festival of Middle Eastern Spirituality and Peace 2005</em>
                            will bring together participants from all walks of life and every major (and
                            many minor) religions active in the Middle East. It is the second such event,
                            following on a successful festival in 2004. This year&#39;s conference will
                            focus on exploring the &quot;missing stories&quot; of the prophets and
                            mystics who speak for peace from within their tradition, with events such as
                            &quot;Spirituality, Health and Healing in the Sufi Tradition,&quot;
                            &quot;Spiritual Perpsectives on the Headscarf Debate in a Changing
                            Europe,&quot; &quot;Deep Listening as Spiritual Practice,&quot; and many
                            others. A keynote lecture on Spiritual Approaches to Middle East Peace will
                            be presented by Abuna Elias Chacour, a Catholic Melkite priest and
                            inter-religious educator and peacemaker from Israel.</p>
                        <p>This publication does not often explicitly promote events before the fact
                            &mdash; particularly as it generally rely on reader submissions and press
                            releases for its material. Nevertheless, we felt it worthwhile to point out
                            the tremendous program they&#39;ve put together, full of music, dance,
                            scholarship, meditation, seminars and workshops. Each of the dozens of events
                            could be inspiration for hundreds of local interfaith groups as they plan
                            their own 2005 activities. To view the schedule, please visit

                        <p>We would also like to share a portion of the organizers&#39; <em>Statement
                                on Diversity</em>, which outlines an amazing vision of inclusivity and
                            organizing principles for a conference:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>One of the purposes of Festival and Conference has been to show that a
                                great range of opinion exists not only between traditions but also within
                                each. The idea that any one group or person can claim to speak for the
                                totality of any religion or spiritual tradition seems greatly outdated in a
                                multi-cultural society, and many scholars of religious studies or
                                comparative spirituality today prefer to speak, for instance, of multiple
                                Christianities, Judaisms and Islams. The media&#39;s tendency to want to
                                stereotype any particular tradition or religion or to quote a single
                                &quot;Christian,&quot; &quot;Jewish,&quot; or &quot;Islamic&quot; opinion
                                on any issue has often hampered more than helped religious and
                                interreligious understanding.</p>
                            <p>As organizers we are seeking to engage a progressively wider and more
                                diverse range of representatives who have been working with spiritual tools
                                in the fields of non-violent conflict resolution and world peace. No
                                speaker represents the totality of any tradition. Likewise, no religious
                                group or organization, or the Festival organization or sponsors, should be
                                identified with the opinions of any speaker, whose opinions remain his/her
                                own. One of the primary principles of the Festival is that all mystical and
                                prophetic voices for non-violence and peace should be allowed a hearing,
                                without censorship or prior vetting by any religious group or
                                organization.</p>
                            <p>Many complex political and ethical issues face religious leaders and
                                organizations today. Speakers may hold various personal points of view on
                                these subjects; however, we have asked that they focus their talks and
                                presentations on spirituality and spiritual approaches for peace, as there
                                are many other forums in which to discuss other, better known political and
                                ethical issues. The conference and festival themselves take no fixed
                                position on any political, ethical or cultural question. We intend rather
                                to create a forum in which we can listen to each other more deeply and
                                learn with a more open mind and heart.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable

                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
