                    <h2>Local Congregations Respond to Growing Religious Diversity </h2>
                    <p class="author">By Gilbert Friend-Jones</p>
                    <p>
                        Elaborate Hindu temples, Islamic masajid and Buddhist monasteries are not quite
                        how the nation perceives the Deep South. Nor do most people expect to find
                        Ethiopian neighborhoods in icy Minnesota. But today, hospitals across America
                        routinely call translators as well as doctors for emergencies. Schools where 20 or more
                        languages are spoken present staggering intercultural challenges. Tamil-speaking
                        congregations, Hispanic radio stations and Vietnamese shopping malls testify to
                        the growing diversity of communities everywhere.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Diana Eck, Director of Harvard University's "Pluralism Project," has documented
                        this shift in mainstream religious life in her book, A New Religious America: How a 'Christian
                        Country' Has Now Become the World's Most Religiously Diverse Nation.
                        Muslims now outnumber Episcopalians in the United States. Los Angeles has more
                        variants of Buddhism than anywhere else in the world. Muslim Girl Scouts promise
                        to "serve Allah and my country." Nor is this solely an American phenomenon.
                        It is happening in many parts of the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        How are local congregations responding to this exploding diversity? In this article a
                        few examples will be drawn from North America and Great Britain, though creative
                        interfaith work is happening everywhere in the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Pass-A-Grille Beach Community UCC, an 850-member congregation near St. Petersburg,
                        FL, has created an Interfaith Ministry Team to address the opportunities and challenges
                        of a multi-cultural world. They conduct monthly "Lunch-And-Learn" sessions where
                        representatives of neighboring non-Christian faith communities share their personal faith
                        and provide overviews of their traditions. Because women's voices often are not heard in
                        interfaith dialogue, this church insists on both male and female presenters. Lunches honor
                        the dietary requirements of the guests. These guests also offer something from their own
                        worship tradition in the church's regular worship.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Within weeks after each session, Pass-A-Grille members visit their guests' particular
                        community of faith. The team maintains a "world religions shelf" in the church's
                        library. It publishes an interfaith calendar, websites and general
                        articles in the church's newsletter. It invites members of other faith traditions to join them
                        for a "Labyrinth Walk For Peace" on New Year's Eve. When Muslims joined them this
                        year, the Christians soon discovered how their meditative walk was congruent with the
                        Islamic practice of haj or pilgrimage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Plymouth Church, a large downtown congregation in Minneapolis, is participating with
                        other Christian, Jewish and Islamic communities to create more affordable housing in
                        their city. For the next five years, hundreds of volunteers from various faith traditions
                        will be working side by side to reclaim an urban neighborhood, while creating an interfaith
                        "neighborhood" of trust and understanding. Forming a partnership with Habitat for
                        Humanity, they hope to raise approximately $3 million for materials. They have
                        committed to build 55 units of mixed but affordable housing over the next five years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "The faith communities of downtown Minneapolis realized that two major benefits
                        would come from our cooperation on issues of affordable housing,"says the Rev. James
                        Gertmenian, Plymouth's senior pastor and a UCC minister. "First, we'd be more able
                        to make a significant response to our city's housing crisis. Second, the visibility of
                        our common effort would be a telling statement in itself, about the nature of faith,
                        the power of our mutual respect, and the passion that we feel about meeting a basic
                        human need."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Central Congregational UCC, Atlanta, GA, now houses four congregations in its
                        facilities &mdash; Jewish, Korean, Cuban and its own. These four come together occasionally
                        for worship, service projects and fellowship. Central UCC has conducted support
                        groups for interfaith couples, and made its Associate Membership category available
                        to individuals whose primary affiliation is with a non-Christian tradition but who
                        wish to associate with the congregation and affirm its covenant. It is currently
                        involved in a citywide effort to create a metropolitan interfaith organization.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Vancouver, Canada, laity and clergy from various faith communities are meeting
                        regularly with politicians, economists and community leaders to address issues
                        of the drug economy, labor disputes, and privatization. They are part of the
                        "Faith and the Common Good" project in ten cities throughout Canada, encouraged
                        by the World Conference on Religion and Peace.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hindu temples, historic synagogues, ancient churches and Islamic mosques now
                        face each other across busy roads in Leicester, England. Jain and Sikh temples
                        testify to the diversity of this community. Where nearby cities are suffering
                        racial and religious violence, Leicester has been cited for its successes in avoiding
                        conflict and fostering mutual support. In 1986, its faith communities organized
                        a "Council of Faiths" to encourage communication and cooperation
                        among themselves and to respond to government initiatives. It is regularly
                        involved in education, health care, police consultations, urban renewal, and
                        community building. In cooperation with the University of Leicester, the Council
                        of Faiths sponsors dialogues and educational opportunities in religious pluralism.
                        Interfaith gardening groups have planted and tilled plots around nearly every
                        house of worship in Leicester, and traveled to nearby Beth Shalom
                        (Britain's Holocaust Center) to work together in its large memorial gardens.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In London, two congregations &mdash; St. Andrew's Anglican and St. Anne's United
                        Reformed -- came together with an ecumenical vision to share a single building,
                        and with an interfaith vision to create the London Inter Faith Centre. Hosted by
                        two Christian churches, this center always works in close consultation with
                        other faith communities. Its goals are to build bridges between faith communities,
                        to broaden Christian perceptions of non-Christian traditions, and to facilitate
                        cooperation with other service organizations. Supported by the Blair government,
                        its mission has grown to national proportions. Following September 11 it
                        organized a number of Christian-Muslim forums. It publishes materials,
                        organizes conferences, maintains an interfaith library, and has developed a
                        "Certificate in Interfaith Relations for Christians."

                    <p>
                        Many US and international organizations exist to encourage interfaith work
                        at the global and local levels. Some are based on individual memberships and
                        some are networks of member organizations. Some are focused on spirituality,
                        some on dialogue, some on advocacy for human rights, peace and social justice.
                        One of the best resources is the Inter Faith Network for the UK.
                        Its small but able staff has published a manual for local interfaith efforts called
                        The Local Inter Faith Guide. The Inter Faith Network also has developed a
                        "code of conduct" that would be of great help to any new interfaith work.

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
