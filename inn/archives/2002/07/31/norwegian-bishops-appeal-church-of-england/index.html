                        Radioactive Waste: "Let Life in the Oceans Continue"</h2>
                    <h3 class="author">By LUTHERAN WORLD INFORMATION</h3>
                    <p>
                        OSLO, Norway/GENEVA, 11 June 2002 (LWI) - Church of Norway bishops
                        have sent a strong appeal for the protection of the environment to
                        the Church of England. The Sellafield Declaration addresses the
                        threat to seas and shores by radioactive waste from the nuclear
                        fuel reprocessing plant at Sellafield, northern England.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through the appeal, the Norwegian church leaders are calling on
                        British authorities to " take all necessary steps to bring an end
                        to the life-threatening pollution as soon as possible."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A Church of Norway press statement says the declaration, handed
                        over on May 29 to the Church of England in London, originates from
                        the local communities and congregations along the Norwegian coast.
                        On its way down the coast from Kirkenes to Bergen, the document
                        was signed by bishops of the five dioceses bordering the North
                        Sea. The country's six other bishops sent their letters of support.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Norwegians are urging their sister church on the other side of
                        the North Sea to follow-up on the matter with the British
                        government. Both churches are signatories to the 1996 Porvoo
                        Common Statement between the British and Irish Anglican churches
                        and most of the Nordic and Baltic Lutheran churches.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under the Nordic Council, Scandinavian governments have criticized
                        British authorities over Sellafield, saying the facility posed a
                        threat to the health of the Irish and North Seas and the Atlantic Ocean.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In their appeal titled "Let Life in the Oceans Continue," Norway's
                        bishops say the existence of a majority of their coastal
                        communities is "inextricably bound to the sea. ... If the
                        resources of the sea become polluted the very existence of the
                        coastal people of our land--and of other lands--will be torn
                        apart." They stress that pollution created by radioactive waste
                        can cause irreparable damage for future generations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a covering letter the Norwegian bishops say: "We see our
                        initiative as one way of deepening the Porvoo communion as it
                        continuously invites us to share resources and concerns as we are
                        involved in service and witness to our societies and the powers [to] be."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The 3.8 million-member Church of Norway to which 86 percent of the
                        population belong, has been a member of the Lutheran World
                        Federation since 1947.

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
