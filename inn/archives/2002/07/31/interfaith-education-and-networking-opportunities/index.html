                            General Theological Seminary in New York City is offering a course on "Religion,
                            Art, Culture and the City" (July 8-12). Using the city itself as an instructional tool,
                            the course will focus on how the city gives shape to both religious understanding
                            and artistic expression. The course will include s concert, a theatre event, an
                            architectural walking tour, visits to museums and cultural sites and a pilgrimage to
                            "Ground Zero" to explore religious imagery that has collected there. Taught by GTS
                            faculty J. Robin Wright, David Hurd and Robert Bruce Mullins, and celebrated artist
                            Simon Carr. <a

                            The THREE FAITHS SUMMER SCHOOL of The Ammerdown Centre, Somerset,
                            UK will sponsor a seminar on "Religion and Medical Ethics" (August 11-18). Recent
                            developments in science and medicine raise profound ethical questions about the
                            meaning and value of human life and the limits and purposes of scientific research.
                            This course will consider Jewish, Muslim and Christian beliefs and teachings in
                            the context of selected issues to do with medical ethics, in order to ask what resources
                            these three religious traditions provide for helping to think ethically about the challenges
                            and opportunities posed by science. Taught by Dr Tina Beattie, freelance writer, lectures
                            in theology, with a particular interest in women's issues and liberation theology, Michael
                            Hilton, a Reform Rabbi and author of 'The Christian Effect on Jewish Life',' and Sheikh
                            Bashir Dultz, the spiritual leader of the German Muslim League. Vegetarian food will be

                            religious freedom and interfaith issues. There will also be an "encounter area" which
                            will be available throughout the Congress and people are invited to join other
                            participants to discuss religious freedom and interfaith issues on an informal basis.

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
