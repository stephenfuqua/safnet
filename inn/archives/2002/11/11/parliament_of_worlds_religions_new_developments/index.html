                    <h2>Parliament of the World's Religions: New Developments and the Goldin Institute</h2>
                    <p class="author">By Paul Chaffee</p>
                    <p class="postdate">November 11, 2002</p>
                    <div class="entry">
                        Parliament of the World's Religions Reaches Out
                        <p> In 1893 the first Parliament of the World's Religions offered Buddhists,
                            Christians, Jains, Jews, and Hindus a shared public forum for the first time
                            in history. Part of a World Exposition, the Parliament commenced a week of interfaith
                            dialogue on September 11. Twelve thousand and more came each day to the building
                            that would become the Chicago Art Institute. Swami Vivakananda, a Hindu who
                            arrived initially without invitation, and then was embraced, particularly electrified
                            the public forums. His charisma, intellect, and generous heart repeatedly challenged
                            the assumption (held by most of the Parliament's planners) that Christianity
                            has a lock on the love of God and could "perfect" whatever goodness
                            and wisdom other religions brought to the table. </p>
                        <p>The crowd rose to its feet to greet this monk in bright saffron robes as soon
                            as he began with the words, "Sisters and brothers of America"
                            After the opening speeches, Swamiji was scheduled by the organizers to conclude
                            each day's sessions, a strategy for keeping everyone in attendance. One
                            can note from his first words that Vivakananda (like the movement he helped
                            inspire) is not a syncretist. "The Christian is not to become a Hindu
                            or a Buddhist, nor a Hindu or a Buddhist to become a Christian. But each must
                            assimilate the spirit of the others and yet preserve his individuality and grow
                            according to his own law of growth," he said in Chicago. He compared the
                            love of God flowing through different religions to rivers all headed towards
                            the sea. He quarreled with the notion that any religion can claim exclusive
                            franchise on the divine, and he sought friendship and common cause among people
                            from all traditions.</p>
                        <p>A centennial celebration of that first event made its own history in 1993 when
                            8,000 people from dozens of different religious traditions again came to Chicago.
                            Subsequently a momentous decision was made to sponsor similarly ambitious gatherings
                            every five years or so, at sites all around the world. </p>
                        <p>The Council for a Parliament of the World's Religions (CPWR) made good
                            on that commitment in 1999 in Cape Town, South Africa. As in Chicago, the experience
                            of attending a Parliament was of homecoming, of meeting members in "our
                            family" we never knew about. In this setting new friends very quickly
                            become dear and important to each other. The "love of God" shines
                            through, regardless of tradition, inviting your own to shine back. Nelson Mandela
                            in great detail told the 7,000 assembled in 1999 how the struggle against Apartheid
                            have failed without various kinds of help that Christian, Hindu, Jewish, and
                            Muslim communities each offered to those who suffered the most in those years
                            of terror. From the bottom of his heart to ours, he let us share the ownership
                            of their victory and South Africa's freedom today. For a moment you could
                            see the whole human family in one room, safe with each other.</p>
                        <p>You can already register (and save a pretty penny by being early) for the Parliament
                            being held July 7-13, 2004 in Barcelona, Spain (<a target="_blank"
                                href="http://www.cpwr.org/">http://www.cpwr.org</a>). As plans go forward,
                            the 1993 hundred-year-old birthday party for interfaith dialogue is morphing
                            into an interfaith movement, engaging activists in every country in the world.
                            Some few have had the opportunity to attend one of the Parliaments. But millions
                            of people in countries everywhere, in villages as in cities, are becoming engaged
                            in a similar, emerging grassroots interfaith community.</p>
                        New developments
                        <p>Anyone disappointed by the failure of the 21st century to quickly usher in
                            a new era of peace can at least take comfort and a ray of hope from recent developments
                            in the nascent interfaith movement. The Parliament is alive and well and developing
                            its relationship with another international grassroots effort, the United Religions
                            Initiative (URI). URI, which in two years has established nearly 200 Cooperation
                            Circles in 36 countries, in August held its first post-Charter-signing Global
                            Assembly in Rio de Janeiro (Cf. "United Religions Initiative Comes of
                            Age in Rio," InterfaithNews.net, September 2002, page 1). URI's
                            Charter had been signed in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 2000, and those who
                            came to Rio were finally able to turn to the multitude of issues they care about,
                            their Charter a foundation now rather than a work-in-progress. </p>
                        <p>Back in Chicago, a similarly significant development is opening a new chapter
                            in the Parliament's life. This past October the curtain went up on what
                            CPWR has been doing in its own backyard for the last 15 years. From the start,
                            Parliament planners have been "local grown," leaders from Chicago's
                            multitudinous faith communities, clergy and laity who cooperatively opened the
                            door to all people of faith and practice. The joy in their work comes from flourishing
                            local relationships.</p>
                        <p>So when the decision was made to continue the massive gatherings, it was grounded
                            with a parallel commitment to stay involved in grassroots interfaith organizing
                            in Chicago. Since the late eighties the Council for the Parliament, its decision-making
                            body, has been active in the city and its suburbs, involving itself with dozens
                            of religious organizations, universities and seminaries, private and civic organizations,
                            in addition to various interfaith groups. Special attention over the years has
                            been invested in a neighborhood called Rogers Park, a quick drive from downtown
                            Chicago. Simply reading the signs over the storefronts when you walk down Rogers
                            Park's main business corridor makes Chicago's ethnic, racial, religious
                            diversity astonishingly clear &mdash; the globe in a single neighborhood. </p>
                        <p>For years the Council's leadership has ruminated on how its extensive
                            Chicago activities should relate to the international gatherings it sponsors
                            twice a decade. Instead of forcing the issue, they lived with it, continuing
                            to nurture both local and global ventures. A strategy has emerged now, suggesting
                            a local-global axis for the interfaith movement capable of empowering interreligious
                            work everywhere. The Golden Institute for International Partnership &amp; Peace
                            was founded to give expression to the strategy. On October 26, at a quiet Dominican
                            priory just west of Chicago, 67 interfaith activists invited from around the
                            world gathered to hear a new dream of partnering between the global Parliament
                            gatherings and grassroots interfaith activities everywhere. </p>
                        The Goldin Institute for International Partnership &amp; Peace
                        <p>Though born in Los Angeles, Diane Goldin brought her theatrical talents to
                            Chicago where a 17-year career as a producer garnered her high reputation for
                            multicultural approaches to the classical repertory. A life-long passion for
                            peace and justice led to her involvement with CPRW. Early in 2002 she made a
                            substantial donation to the Parliament for a five-year project called the Goldin
                            Institute. The Institute is dedicated to building "partnerships"
                            with grassroots interfaith communities everywhere who would like to have a formal
                            relationship with the group organizing the massive gatherings so many enjoyed
                            in Cape Town and will enjoy in Barcelona in the summer of 2004.</p>
                        <p>The weeklong Institute agenda was packed, leavened with long breaks and leisurely
                            meals. In short order, people had a chance to meet each other one-on-one for
                            an hour, and introduced each other in groups of eight. Then we went to work.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Professor Patrice Brodeur of Connecticut College set the pace in a challenging
                                keynote about interfaith activities moving from the periphery to the center
                                of the religious community-at-large and the need to study "applied religion."</li>
                            <li>A day was spent on the increasingly important role of intrafaith relations
                                (activities connecting different segments of a single tradition) if interfaith
                                work is to have a significant influence in the world. </li>
                            <li>he Parliament's many Chicago projects were surveyed. Through the week
                                a dozen different religious and cultural sites in and near Chicago were visited,
                                with dozens of stories about interfaith activities from people at each site.
                                Gurdwara, church, synagogue, and mosque were all visited.</li>
                            <li>Participants from South Africa, the Middle East, Taiwan, and Brazil were
                                given time to survey the considerable efforts going on in their organizations
                                back home. At table and on buses the conversation never ceased, and the shear
                                size of global grassroots activities started sinking in.</li>
                            <li> In one case, participants had to choose a day examining relations between
                                Chicago's Muslims and the rest of the community or interfaith activities
                                on campus. Afterwards participants gave high marks to both options.</li>
                            <li> Visiting the spot where Vivekananda addressed the Parliament 109 years
                                ago particularly moved long-timers in the interfaith vineyard. At the Chicago
                                Art Institute we also visited the large room where "Towards a Global
                                Ethic &mdash; An Initial Declaration" was debated and signed by 200
                                religious leaders at the 1993 Parliament. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As Goldin Institute went into its fourth day, the Parliament's dreams
                            for formal partnerships built around specific proposals and agreements were
                            detailed. Partnerships will mostly be with interfaith coalitions in cities around
                            the world, though smaller communities will also be welcomed in creating partnerships.
                            Time was scheduled for people to work in small groups and begin considering
                            what could be done in their own backyards that would benefit from a relationship
                            with CPWR. When time ran out, cards and email addresses were exchanged along
                            with promises to stay in touch. </p>
                        The Possibilities Ahead
                        <p>Grounding the dialogue at URI's Global Assembly and the Parliament's
                            Goldin Institute were some shared assumptions. Above all, collaboration is the
                            watchword today. Working together, relating across traditional turf boundaries,
                            sharing resources, cooperating rather than competing, integrated financial strategies
                            to fund a plenitude of grassroots efforts &mdash; these themes came up over
                            and again, in Chicago as in Rio. Such sentiments are easy to mouth, but the
                            events themselves make the case. Dozens of those in Rio were Parliament alums
                            from 1993 and 1999, and two of the Parliament's executive staff were full
                            participants at URI's 2002 Assembly.</p>
                        <p>Similarly, nearly a third of the Goldin Institutes participants have been active
                            in URI activities, including four past and current URI Global Council trustees.
                            Growing out of collaboration, the phrase "capacity building" could
                            be heard over and over in both CPWR and URI settings. Some have wondered out
                            loud why we need more than one major grassroots international interfaith organization.
                            Those who feel that ending religiously motivated violence and creating cultures
                            of peace is actually critical to the human family's survival quickly see
                            the efficacy in not two or three major interfaith organizations but many. On
                            the global stage, the interfaith movement is still working through day one or
                            two, and multiplying our aggregate capacity for generating mutual respect, peace,
                            and justice tops the collective agenda.</p>
                        <p>In a world darkened by conflict and turmoil, Goldin Institute participants
                            headed home with hope. The world we each live in had been enlarged with new
                            friends and the promise of creative partnerships for healing the world. </p>

                    <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                        sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                        has sprung from the
                        grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                        to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                        and religious news, events,
                        and resources.</p>
