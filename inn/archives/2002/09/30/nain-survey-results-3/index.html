                    <p>Bravo NAIN!</p>
                    <p>You are to be commended for your use of the Survey method to
                        elicit responses from us members. As a famous philosopher
                        once wrote, &quot;If you want to discover what people want, need
                        or change, ASK THEM INDIVIDUALLY!&quot; &ndash; not bothering to
                        listen to what their political &quot;leaders&quot; might tell you
                        what they think</p>
                    <p>I have personally enjoyed NAIN. It has not significantly
                        benefited my organization. Higher visibility for interfaith
                        relationships and organizations is needed, but beware the burden of
                        staff. It will bend to change NAIN from a network to an
                        organization. I suggest using contract consultants for
                        necessary and desirable projects rather than opening an office and
                        hiring staff.</p>
                    <p>I have lived in Columbus for four months and am just getting
                        acquainted with local people and organization. Previously, I
                        spent 16 years in New York City at Auburn Seminary where I was
                        involved in developing interfaith programs such as &quot;Building
                        Bridges: Understanding Our Neighbors Faiths&quot; and
                        &quot;A Spiritual Journey: Interfaith
                        Perspectives&quot;. I hope to get more involved in
                        interreligious activities as a volunteer.</p>
                    <p>Let's brainstorm about the fundraising. I appreciate
                        this questionnaire. A staff person is a very important
                        addition &ndash; the time has come!</p>
                    <p>Contact interfaith staff persons for all major faiths and
                        denominations. Most have such a person or department.
                        Good survey! Interesting that the word &quot;advocacy&quot;
                        is used several times. I&rsquo;d like to encourage such
                        advocacy &ndash; but have always been rebuffed by comments such as
                        &quot;No, we're just a network.&quot; &quot;We
                        don't advocate for anything. We don't take
                        stands.&quot;</p>
                    <p>I'm not certain Mexico belongs in NAIN at this time, as I
                        have mentioned to Don Mayne. Until such time as some NAIN
                        member groups have Latino participants from the USA or Canada, it
                        seems premature for the Mexican Interfaith Council to be a member
                        of NAIN. Nevertheless I am encouraging Mexican participation
                        at Wichita by a Catholic priest (who went to Fullerton) and a 33
                        year old Anglican priest who is applying to Christy Lohr for a
                        Youth Scholarship.</p>
                    <p>Thanks for this survey. I wish it had been on line.
                        About five years ago, the Religious Education Association retired
                        its staff associate &ndash; a very <em>big</em> mistake. I am
                        glad you are thinking about adding staff. We are a non-profit
                        organization founded in 1908.</p>
                    <p>The question of a staff person needs to be considered very
                        thoughtfully because this person (is the organization he/she is
                        attached to, if applicable) could become &quot;the face&quot; of
                        NAIN thus moving the &quot;imagery&quot; from an association of
                        interfaith organizations to an individual. This is not
                        necessarily a problem, but something that simply needs to be
                        acknowledged and considered. (Alison Van Dyk, Temple of
                        Understanding)</p>
                    <p>Thank you for your excellent initiative on this
                        survey.</p>
                    <p>NAIN was structured as a network but the quality of Board
                        participation and governance has crippled its effectiveness.
                        A staff member does not solve this dysfunction. Before NAIN
                        embarks on a commitment to staffing, it needs to hold a board
                        retreat and engage in strategic planning with a facilitator.</p>
                    <p>Since NAIN has always avoided program commitments, it is hard to
                        define what a staff person should do beyond networking. I
                        feel that most of the board is pretty much unengaged in the
                        organization, providing no networking to speak of. So perhaps
                        we &ndash; the board and member organizations &ndash; first have to
                        define new possibilities for, and values of, networking.</p>
                    <p>I think others besides myself (newsletter editor/web editor)
                        should be responsible for communications, and should provide
                        substantive communications of networking value. Very few
                        board members or organizations provide news or resource info.
                        At this time, the only communications members get, besides the
                        newsletter and nascent Interfaith E-Digest (also from me) are
                        membership renewal reminders.</p>
                    <p>It is important that people in North America (and elsewhere)
                        realize the degree of inter-religious cooperation and community
                        that exists and continues to thrive in North America. It can
                        easily be the role of NAIN to help educate the general public about
                        successful and positive models of living together. Media
                        contacts and news stories should go beyond our NAIN membership to
                        the broader public. These stories can play a vital role in
                        reinforcing the strengths of a religiously plural democracy,
                        particularly now.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This cannot be done on a volunteer basis without having at least
                        staff-based coordination. Our website is a first step in a
                        very large area of growth.</p>

                                The InterfaithNews.Net service ran from 2002 through 2006, hosting articles on the

                    <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                        sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                        has sprung from the
                        grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                        to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                        and religious news, events,
                        and resources.</p>
