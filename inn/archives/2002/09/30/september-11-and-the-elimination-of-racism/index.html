                <h1>September 11 and the Elimination of Racism</h1>
                <p class="author">By Don Mayne</p>
                <p>A little over a year ago I wrote a message as Chair of the North American
                    Interfaith Network (NAIN), concluding with the following:</p>
                <p>&quot;In addition to our prayers for peace and for the victims of terrorism
                    and war, I believe that the interfaith community has a responsibility to help
                    prevent inappropriate acts of discrimination and blaming. I have been concerned
                    about 'scapegoating' of Muslims and people of other faiths. We must raise our
                    voices to insist that innocent people not be blamed or made to suffer for the
                    actions of people who have no connection with them. As members of the NAIN
                    network we can promote understanding of all the world's religions, and the
                    acceptance of differences in culture and traditions.&quot;</p>
                <p>Those words are still true today. At our recent NAIN conference in Wichita,
                    Kansas, many members of local interfaith organizations reported on increased
                    interest from their communities to learn more about the Muslim faith and other
                    faiths. People are realizing that, while each religion has its own history,
                    faith, beliefs and practices, none-the-less we have much in common so that the
                    more we learn of each other's beliefs and practices, the more likely we are to
                    work together in peace.</p>
                <p>Many organizations held prayer services following the September 11 attacks,
                    praying together, as persons of different faiths, for peace and for the victims
                    of terrorism, and together we have a common bond which binds us as citizens of
                    the world.</p>
                <p>Yet we still have the concern that innocent people, and in particular
                    followers of Islam, have been the victims of &quot;scapegoating&quot;.
                    Interfaith organizations have a responsibility to support those who have faced
                    discrimination and to work to prevent it. We have much experience in promoting
                    understanding of the faiths of our neighbours, and we can be an example to the
                    people of our communities in expressing our care and support for those who face
                    discrimination.</p>
                <p>While most groups will mark September 11, 2002 with prayers and actions of
                    support for each other, there are other times of the year at which it will be
                    appropriate to formally take a stand against racism and for inter-religious
                    harmony. I think particularly of March 21, the United Nations-sponsored
                    International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.</p>
                <p>This date was established by the United Nations in 1966 to remind the world
                    of the massacre in Sharpeville, South Africa, in 1960 when police opened fire on
                    hundreds of peaceful demonstrators against Apartheid passbook laws, killing 67
                    and wounding 186. Many nations have adopted that date as a time for special
                    prayers for peace and for the elimination of racial discrimination in their
                    communities and around the world.</p>
                <p>One example of taking a stand March 21 happens in Edmonton, Alberta, where
                    the Edmonton Interfaith Centre for Education and Action has held a public prayer
                    service at the City Hall for ten years, with up to fourteen world religions
                    offering prayers for the elimination of racism. Each group prays in their own
                    tradition, in words, song, chants, dance, or silence, with representatives
                    generally wearing their traditional worship garb.</p>
                <p>Events such as these are a powerful witness to the unity which we have as
                    people of faith, and our concern to help our communities remove the blight of
                    racism from our midst - throughout the year.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
