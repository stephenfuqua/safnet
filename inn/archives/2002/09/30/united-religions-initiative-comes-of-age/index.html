                <p class="author">By Paul Chaffee</p>
                <p class="postdate">September, 2002</p>
                <p>Like the German chocolate cake they serve at the Hotel Gloria in Rio de
                    Janeiro, the 2002 United Religions Initiative Global Assembly was a many-layered
                    splendor. The sweetness of the August gathering, with its theme of Sharing the
                    Sacred - Serving the World, came from dozens of one-on-one and group
                    conversations we each had with new and old friends, gathered from 37 countries
                    and approximately 50 religious traditions.</p>
                <p>Even more than in past years, the 300 participants were grassroots leaders
                    from around the world engaged in creating and developing interfaith groups in
                    their home communities, usually using a URI Cooperation Circle format. Rather
                    than one-time conferees, they came to Rio as the eyes, ears, and voice of
                    hundreds, sometimes thousands of others. And they brought remarkable stories.</p>
                <p>Sheik Musa Fhalil, 43, comes from Gulu in northern Uganda. We met getting on
                    a bus for the peace-march at Copacabana Beach. Tall and slim in soft cotton
                    robes and turban, Imam Musa is the spiritual leader or &quot;District Kahd&quot;
                    of 50,000 Muslims in his region. A glowing smile unlocks his reserve, and his
                    occasional public words always quieted the room, catching the Assembly's
                    attention. He flew to Rio as spokesperson for himself and three other leaders,
                    Anglican and Coptic bishops and a Roman Catholic archbishop, members of the
                    Acholi Religious Leaders Peace Initiative CC.</p>
                <p>In 1996 these leaders and their colleagues stepped beyond their differences
                    to see if they could become interfaith peacemaking partners against what is now
                    a 17-year-old civil war. They live in communities where, day and night, people
                    are dispensable pawns caught between tanks and machine-gun warriors. Any kind of
                    travel is particularly dangerous, coming to Rio a risk. Yet six years since the
                    pact their peacemaking role has assumed national dimension, casting them in the
                    role of negotiators.</p>
                <p>When Sheik Fhalil and I stole a couple hours to talk in one of Hotel
                    Gloria's restaurants, negotiations towards a significant breakthrough were
                    going forward a continent away. A phone call earlier in the day said Ugandan
                    newspapers had reported the rebels' decision to kill religious leaders. &quot;But
                    I think it is a false report,&quot; said Musa softly. The rebels are as
                    desperate for real peace as the government, and the religious leaders have
                    earned the trust of both sides.</p>
                <p>Conversations with Sheik Fhalil, URI trustee Ms. Despina Namwembe from
                    Kampala, and other Ugandan participants suggested the possibility of creating a
                    relationship between the Interfaith Center at the Presidio and URI circles in
                    Uganda. Everyone in Rio was doing the same thing - sharing concerns, dreaming
                    about collaborative opportunities, sharing addresses.</p>
                <h3>Making History</h3>
                <p>Along with the stories, historic markers emerged at Sharing the Sacred -
                    Serving the World, signaling a coming of age for the organization and its role
                    in a growing global interfaith movement:</p>
                <p>&sect; For the first time URI left the United States to hold a global assembly,
                    and the spiritually interfaith, artistically rich, indigenous-appreciative
                    organizing energy of the Brazilian host team was breathtaking. Simultaneous
                    English-Portuguese translation into English, with individual translators for
                    Spanish, was largely successful in plenary sessions, and a team of translators
                    fanned out to small group discussions and kept people communicating. Equally
                    impressive was the multi-program interfaith engagement with Rio's harsh poverty
                    and the grace and imagination that bubbled up as our hosts shared their mission
                    efforts with us.</p>
                <p>Anyone supposing that the Charter-writing URI gatherings at Stanford in the
                    late 90s were fuzzy-wuzzy feel-good sessions would have been disabused of this
                    notion in Rio. In a country with the world's most complex human DNA, URI in the
                    aggregate seemed totally at home with itself. Rio's complexities and
                    attractions inspired us to think in new ways about living creatively into the
                    global challenge of huge, multiplying megalopolises around the world.</p>
                <p>&sect; At Rio the long-serving URI Interim Global Council gave way to a newly
                    elected Global Council, a transition that signals better global representation
                    and less dependence on northern California participation. Symbolically, having a
                    Russian circle represented in the Assembly for the first time was also
                    important. URI headquarters remain in San Francisco. But nearly a dozen trustees
                    stepped down, replaced by a much more geographically distributed class of
                    leaders, including a Muslim woman from Tajikistan. With this shift, URI has
                    clearly established its international bona fides.</p>
                <p>&sect; Following four years of Charter-writing summits, the Charter-signing
                    celebration in 2000, and regional assemblies this past year in Africa,
                    Asia-Pacific, Europe-Middle East, North America, and South America, URI was
                    finally ready in August 2002 to pay more attention to the second half of its
                    Charter. On those pages a broad action agenda is outlined foreseeing global URI
                    activity generated around (1) sharing wisdom and cultures of faith traditions,
                    (2) nurturing cultures of healing and peace, (3) rights and responsibilities,
                    (4) ecological imperatives, (5) sustainable just economics, and (6) supporting
                    the overall URI.</p>
                <p>Each of these tracks was introduced and given time at Rio, though it was
                    mostly tip-of-the-iceberg stuff at this point, sharing stories and initial
                    dreams as a way to begin.</p>
                <p>Equally important, thematically, was an emphasis on positive peacemaking
                    skills and the introduction of a new URI global program, &quot;Visions for
                    Peace Among Religions.&quot; Professor Mohammed Abu-Nimer, a Palestinian
                    Muslim doing pioneering work in positive peacemaking out of Washington DC's
                    American University, received more lecture-time with the Assembly than any
                    speaker in URI history. His three sessions surveying new approaches to making
                    peace received a standing ovation.</p>
                <p>&sect; On several occasions the need for intrafaith (relations within a
                    tradition) activity to support interfaith work emerged as a significant theme.
                    As Professor Abu-Nimer said, &quot;If as a Christian you want to respect me
                    as a Muslim, the first thing is to go back and work within your Christian
                    community about issues of respect.&quot; Indigenous participants in URI have
                    already come together as a community within the community, and similar
                    intrafaith activities seem likely to be sprouting up soon, particularly as more
                    interfaith educational materials are developed. It may well be that generating
                    respect and peace within faith families is more difficult than doing so between
                    traditions.</p>
                <p>&sect; Leaders of the Council for a Parliament of the World's Religions and
                    United Religions Initiative have always been friendly, but Rio witnessed a
                    developing partnership between these two relatively young international
                    grassroots organizations. Earlier this summer, before the Assembly, members of
                    the Parliament's Council visited Charles Gibbs, URI's executive, and talked
                    about new kinds of cooperation.</p>
                <p>The Parliament subsequently double-staffed Rio URI with executives Josh
                    Borkin and Travis Rejman. They came with Parliament news on the tip of their
                    tongues and were clearly happy to be full participants in the Assembly. Thursday
                    evening was a 'free' night for exploring Rio. But about 70 conferees,
                    including URI's president, the Rt. Rev. William Swing and his wife Mary,
                    attended a specially scheduled 8:00 p.m. session on the Parliament. Plans were
                    shared about the July 14-21, 2004 Parliament in Barcelona. URI circles were
                    encouraged to plan their own Barcelona meetings in conjunction with the
                    Parliament. Various partnering possibilities were envisioned in an hour of
                    discussion.</p>
                <h3>Finances &amp; The Future</h3>
                <p>Just prior to the Assembly, at the Interim Global Council's last meeting,
                    trustees were joined by the soon-to-be installed newcomers in the Global
                    Council. Their shared agenda concluded with finances and fundraising. A
                    challenging financial picture and an ambitious fundraising report both were
                    sobering. But the morning's meeting concluded with an appreciative exercise: in
                    small groups people shared with each other best stories about successful
                    attempts to meet challenging financial needs.</p>
                <p>The buzz from these conversations led Deepak Naik, continuing trustee from
                    the United Kingdom, to call an ad hoc breakfast meeting at seven o'clock the
                    next morning. A dozen showed up the first day, and the session moved to a
                    separate dining room as the week progressed and 20 folks braved the early hour
                    to be involved.</p>
                <p>Outcomes of those meetings include a new, still-to-be-named philanthropy
                    cooperation circle. And a three-year 14-member international fundraising policy
                    group aimed at long-term financial sustainability will be chaired by Bishop
                    Swing. Grimness about paying our bills gave way to a measured enthusiasm as the
                    ad hoc committee's work was summarized each day for the Assembly.</p>
                <p>Finances were not ignored, in other words, in Rio. But the vitality of URI
                    will always be the power of women and men of faith and practice who revel in
                    their diversity and differences while embracing an activist's posture toward
                    creating a world where the broken are healed, where respect, safety, and
                    opportunity are normative for the whole human family and our wounded home, the
                    Earth. Working one person at a time is not a problem for this movement, or the
                    fact that the work has only just begun. We left our stories with each other and
                    headed home to share them with our families, magnify them, and create new ones.</p>
                <p>Charles Gibbs' mother, Ruth, goes back to Tulsa, Oklahoma, to start a
                    grandmother's cooperation circle. Trustee Yehuda Stolov returns to Jerusalem to
                    lead the astonishing Interfaith Encounter Association, successfully sponsoring
                    interfaith dialogue in half a dozen 'impossible' contexts. A group of URI
                    South Asian leaders returned home talking about a peace pilgrimage connecting
                    India and Pakistan. Our hearts, prayers, and a few checks went home with
                    brothers and sisters returning to recently troubled countries like Argentina and
                    Venezuela and the many returning to countries suffering war, wracking poverty,
                    and environmental degradation.</p>
                <p>Brazil offered a unique library of stories and learning experiences for each
                    of us attending Sharing the Sacred - Serving the World. It was a healing,
                    generative place, safe in spite of a sometimes-overwrought reputation for
                    muggers and pickpockets.</p>
                <p>The charming side of Rio's reputation - its beauty and music and wonderful
                    cosmopolitan people - made the week a five-star event. Our official hosts, the
                    Rio Interfaith Movement, the Sao Paulo CC and Viva Rio, with URI trustee Andre
                    Porto chairing the host committee, presented their community as a living example
                    of why interfaith cooperation is so important and how it can succeed in
                    difficult circumstances. For that we say Thank-you! Or as we learned to say in
                    Rio, Obrigato!</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
