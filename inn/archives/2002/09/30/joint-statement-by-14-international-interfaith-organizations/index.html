                <h2>Joint Statement by 14 International Interfaith Organizations</h2>
                <p class="lead">Nearly a year ago, a loose coalition of international interfaith organizations issued
                    the following statement. It's contents are still appropriate, and the links provide initial access
                    to their programs.</p>
                <p>
                    In response to recent tragic events in the United States of America and ongoing conflicts with
                    religious dimensions around the world, our international interfaith organisations offer our
                    inter-religious dialogue expertise and resources to address the current crisis and promote peace
                    building initiatives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have direct experience of bringing into peaceful and constructive dialogue the mainstream and
                    marginalised, moderate and militant religious voices of our world. Working with the world's faith
                    communities, we have found that inter-religious dialogue can help heal wounds caused by feelings of
                    injustice, isolation, and inequality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our international interfaith organisations with their global outreach and networks offer peaceful
                    alternatives to war. Contact us:

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
