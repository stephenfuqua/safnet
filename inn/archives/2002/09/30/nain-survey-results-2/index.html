                    picked a paper with the name of the circle to find out where to
                    sit. Thus, groups were diverse. Group dialogue on how
                    your religion influences how you spend your leisure time, raise

                    Advocacy Program: Housing Sabbath Project</h3>
                <p>Housing Sabbath is a unique way in which the interfaith
                    community increases its understanding of issues related to our
                    housing crisis and the housing element process. Members of
                    faith communities become involved as advocates for effective
                    affordable housing. While the actual Sabbath experience takes
                    place on a designated Friday through Sunday, the project includes
                    activities in preparation for those events as well as time for
                    follow-up and integration following the actual Sabbath.
                    Project is intergenerational &ndash; children, youth, adults and
                    seniors. Resources developed reflect different
                    generation-specific participants. Project is coordinated by
                    Interfaith Council with high school students invited to participate
                    as part of their community service responsibilities. Project
                    began on July 1 and ended on December 15, 2001.</p>

                    Dialogue into Advocacy Program: Multifaith
                    Exploration and Exchange</h3>
                <p>This program begins with recruitment of members of various
                    religious traditions found in a given local area. After an
                    evening orientation, the group visits the religious community
                    and/or place of worship of each religious tradition. While
                    there, they receive teaching, observe/participate in the
                    traditional worship, and develop dialogue/q&amp;a about what they
                    have experienced. Often fellowship with members of the
                    community over shared refreshments follows. The program
                    begins in January of each year and goes through June with about two
                    visits per month. Blessing Night closes the experience.
                    The program develops a cohesive interfaith community which may be
                    invited to speak out on advocacy issues affecting the religious
                    life of the community. It has been held in Dallas, Texas for
                    about eight years, and has been adapted in other cities (Fresno,
                    Edmonton, Fort Worth, Milwaukee, etc.)</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
