                <h2>The Next Parliament of the World's Religions
                    -In Barcelona, 2004</h2>
                <p class="author">By Joel Beversluis</p>
                <p>
                    The Council for a Parliament of the World's Religions (CPWR) is
                    delighted to announce its next international event. The July, 2004
                    Parliament will be the signature event of a 141-day Forum of Cultures,
                    co-sponsored by the Universal Forum of Cultures Barcelona 2004,
                    with the support of UNESCO.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The decision to select Barcelona was made after a year-long process
                    co-chaired by Helen Spector, a CPWR Trustee, and Travis Rejman,
                    Associate Director for CPWR's Partner Cities Program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &quot;The political, social, and cultural climate of Spain, and Barcelona
                    in particular, make it an ideal host site for the 2004 Parliament,&quot;
                    noted Spector. Attendees of the Parliament will learn of the
                    extraordinary reconciliation process headed by governmental,
                    educational, cultural, and religious organizations to heal the historic
                    wounds remaining from Spain's treatment of Jews, Muslims and the
                    indigenous peoples of the Americas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Universal Forum of Cultures, the first ever of its kind, will take
                    place in the northern seafront of Barcelona, in a 100 acre public
                    park overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. The Forum, grounded
                    in a commitment to constructive dialogue between cultures, will
                    focus on three core themes essential to human progress and
                    development: the conditions for peace, sustainable development,
                    and ways to protect and promote respect for cultural diversity.

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
