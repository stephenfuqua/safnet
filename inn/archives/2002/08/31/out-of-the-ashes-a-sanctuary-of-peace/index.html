                    </div>
                    <p class="author">By Joel Beversluis</p>
                    <p class="postdate">August 31st, 2002 </p>
                    <div class="entry">
                        <p>When the media replay footage from 9/11, what do we see? What feelings
                            are we reinforcing &mdash; or numbing?</p>
                        <p>And when educators present that hard lesson in the schools, what will
                            our children see and feel and draw? Educators report that they&#39;re
                            still making pictures of exploding planes and towers. Especially for
                            children, images have power for good or ill. We understand, don&#39;t we,
                            that we must try to replace those repetitious and fearsome pictures with
                            healing images?</p>
                        <p>So, let&#39;s instead raise up new images, symbols of hope that can
                            reinvigorate the ideals of peace and understanding.</p>
                        <p>For instance, let&#39;s imagine together a place of inter-religious
                            healing, a place where peace-making is blessed, a sanctuary rising out of
                            the ashes. Imagine it rendered in sand or clay or paint, in colors, sounds or
                            stories.</p>
                        <p>Take a moment: What would an interfaith sanctuary of peace look like?
                            A temple, a church, a mosque, a garden, a fountain, a wall, a bridge?</p>
                        <p>Besides restoring emotional health, creative and life-giving images
                            can provide opportunities for reflection, dialogue and learning. They may
                            also help shape the memorial at
                            <span class="abbr" title="Former World Trade Center site in New York City">
                                Ground Zero</span>.
                        </p>
                        <p>Like the Center for World Thanksgiving in downtown Dallas, this
                            Sanctuary could be an oasis of inter-religious and inter-cultural
                            understanding and appreciation.</p>
                        <p>What words and sounds give it life? Can you hear a mass? a concert? a
                            call to prayer?</p>
                        <p>Like the Interfaith Chapel at the Presidio &mdash; formerly a military base
                            chapel &mdash; Ground Zero, a symbol of powers in conflict, can become a place
                            where peace is revered, inspired by the holiest wisdom we can find.</p>
                        <p>What wisdom is that? An interfaith Sanctuary can identify it in the
                            world&#39;s religions and spiritual traditions, which serve as
                            repositories of the wisdom of humanity, inspired, many believe, by the
                            Divine.</p>
                        <p>Sanctuary can also be a memorial to those of so many faiths who died
                            that September day. And a memorial as well to so many more who have faced
                            the terror of wars since then. Like Auschwitz or Hiroshima, this Sanctuary
                            can also be a place for prayer and commitment: Never Again! This shrine can
                            honor people of all faiths and philosophies who live and work together in
                            many places for the common good. Who are they and what are they doing?</p>
                        <p>A sacred place such as this can inspire all those &mdash; young and old,
                            rich and poor, religious and secular &mdash; who can grasp the dream and the
                            seek the details of a more peaceful world.</p>
                        <p>Can we transform the fears and pride that lead to war? How can we make
                            peace with the Earth?</p>
                        <p>Add your creative juices to this process! Where&#39;s your
                            passion? You and your networks can help the healing. And you can join a
                            groundswell of support for a Sanctuary of Peace. With your help, voices
                            and visions will rise up in classrooms, religious and spiritual communities,
                            interfaith organizations, civic groups, and in the media.</p>
                        <p>With your help, &quot;movers and shakers,&quot; financiers and
                            politicians, religious and spiritual leaders, interfaith organizations in
                            New York, and people of good will everywhere can be dreaming-into-being
                            new ways of living together &mdash; symbolized by our visions of a Sanctuary of
                            Peace.</p>
                        <p>Out of the ashes and compost and water beneath the city streets,
                            let&#39;s plant and raise up some new life!</p>
                        <p>Readers are invited to develop or encourage Sanctuary projects in
                            schools, congregations, and organizations.</p>
                        <p>You may also want to pass this proposal or your Sanctuary vision on to
                            others in your network, to Mayor Bloomberg of New York, President George
                            Bush, influential philanthropists, elected representatives, educators and
                            religious leaders.</p>
                        <p>Thank you.</p>

                            The InterfaithNews.Net service ran from 2002 through 2006, hosting articles on the

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
