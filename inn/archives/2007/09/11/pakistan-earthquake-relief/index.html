                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable

                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
