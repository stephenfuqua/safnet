                    <div class="entry">
                        <p>
                            The <a href="http://www.npf.or.jp/" target="_blank">Niwano Peace
                                Foundation</a> has awarded their twenty-first Peace Price for 2004 to
                            <a href="http://www.acholipeace.org/index.html" target="_blank">Acholi
                                Religious Leaders Peace Iniziative</a> (ARLPI), a
                            multi-faith peace group which for the last seven years has been seeking a
                            peaceful resolution to the 18-year old war that affects Northern Uganda.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The award ceremony will be held in Tokyo on May 11. It will be attended
                            by ARLPI
                            representatives of its four religious denominations: Archbishop John
                            Baptist Odama, of Gulu Catholic Diocese and current chairman of the
                            group; Anglican Bishop Nelson Onono-Onweng, of Northern Uganda, the
                            Acholi Khadi Shiek Musa Khalil and the head of the Orthodox Church in
                            Acholi Fr. Julius Orach.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is the first time that this price has been awarded to an African
                            organisation by the Niwano Foundation. The institute, based in Japan, was
                            established in 1978 by a lay Buddish Association, "to honour and
                            encourage those who are devoting themselves to interreligious
                            co-operation in the cause of peace". Previous recipients include:
                            Archbishop Helder Camara and Cardinal Paulo Arns of Brazil, the
                            Corrymeela Community of Northern Ireland, the Community of
                            Sant?Egidio, Rev. Elias Chacour of Israel and Bishop Samuel Ruiz of
                            Chiapas, Mexico. The prize includes 20 million yen, which ARLPI has already
                            decided it will use to build a Peace Centre in Gulu.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Acholi Religious Leaders? Peace Initiative?s origins can be
                            traced to July 1997, when Christians from the two main denominations and
                            Muslims in Kitgum came together to pray and advocate for peace in
                            Northern Uganda. Similar initiatives started in Gulu at around the same
                            time. From these experiences, ARLPI was formally
                            inaugurated in February 1998. Its first chairman was Bishop Nelson
                            Onono-Onweng. Ever since, ARLPI has
                            established a network of peace committees in the main centres throughout
                            the Acholi sub-region. It has also mediated in violent conflict between
                            the Acholi and their Jie neighbours, and also between Teso and Karimojong
                            rural communities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Throughout its existence ARLPI has
                            consistently documented facts about the war and advocated for peace and
                            human rights in national and international fora. In 2001 it published a
                            detailed report where it called for the dismantling of the displaced
                            camps in Acholi and the following year it assessed the mixed success of
                            the Amnesty Law. This advocacy effort has not been made only in writing
                            documents, but also in actions in clear support of the most vulnerable
                            victims of the conflict, as it happened at the end of June 2003 when the
                            religious leaders spent four nights sleeping in the cold streets of Gulu
                            together with the thousands of child night-commuters who every night seek
                            safety in the town. Also, every year at the end of December
                            ARLPI organises
                            peace rallies and prayers in the main towns affected by the war, helping
                            people to express their deep desires for an end to the violence. In 2002
                            it also started the Acholi Education Initiative, a bursary foundation to
                            help several hundred student orphans in secondary schools.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But it is its effort to mediate between the Government of Uganda and the
                            rebel group Lord?s Resistance Army (LRA) that has won
                            ARLPI international
                            recognition as the voice of the suffering people of Northern Uganda. Some
                            discreet contacts with LRA officers during 2001 led to some of them
                            laying down their arms and taking advantage of the current Government
                            Amnesty. In 2002, soon after the launching by the Ugandan Army of the
                            "Operation Iron Fist" inside Sudan &mdash; a move publicly
                            opposed by ARLPI &mdash; some of the
                            main religious leaders together with some traditional cultural leaders,
                            after getting the Government's consent, started meeting with the
                            LRA top commanders in the bush in an effort to be a bridge between them
                            and the Government of Uganda so that peace conversations could take
                            place. Twenty-one of meetings of this kind have taken place, often amid
                            high risks, misunderstandings and threats. Despite all these trials,
                            ARLPI's
                            position about a peaceful end to the conflict has remained firm.

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
