                        <p>
                            SAN RAFAEL, CA (May 13, 2004) - The <a href="http://www.thegaia.org/">Global
                                AIDS Interfaith Alliance</a> (GAIA) announced today that an art exhibition celebrating
                            the legacy of
                            African culture will open at the Dominican University library from June
                            10 through August 27. Entitled "The Splendid Culture of Africa:
                            Preserving a Legacy," the exhibit is sponsored by GAIA and supported by
                            the School of Arts and Sciences at Dominican University. The exhibit can
                            be viewed at Archbishop Alemany Library Gallery, 50 Acacia Avenue.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Prominently displayed in the show will be textiles and sculptures from
                            the galleries of Dave DeRoche and Kathleen Taylor, noted collectors of
                            African Art. Major sponsors of the event include Bingham, Osborn &amp;
                            Scarborough LLC, the William and Gretchen Kimball Fund, and Ann Green and
                            Bill Smith of Frank Howard Allen Realtors, along with a number of
                            individual patrons.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The opening reception will be held Thursday June 10, 2004 in the Library
                            Gallery from 5:30 to 8:00 pm. Tickets to the opening reception, which is
                            also a benefit for GAIA, are $50.00.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The exhibition is a celebration of Africa's rich culture and the urgent
                            need to preserve it. "Africa's incredible legacy is being threatened by
                            HIV/AIDS because so many people in the prime of their life are being
                            wiped out," says Amy Rankin-Williams, Development Director of GAIA. "Here
                            is the beauty, here is the threat, and here is the response of GAIA."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Global AIDS Interfaith Alliance, based in San Francisco, partners
                            with religious organizations in the Central African country of Malawi to
                            provide hope and attention to these citizens by delivering care, testing,
                            supplies, and community-based education. Fifteen percent of the country's
                            citizens currently live with the HIV virus. Through this exhibit, GAIA
                            seeks to raise funds for their efforts in Malawi while providing
                            education and awareness to the local community.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The pieces in the exhibition are primarily ritual/ceremonial and objects
                            used in everyday life. "African art is not art for art's sake," explains
                            Sandi Chin, exhibition Curator and Art History Professor at Dominican
                            University. "Art is imbued in everyday life. Through the art you can see
                            the social outlooks and religious beliefs, as well as the aesthetic
                            elements."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This cultural perspective of African life will be complemented by an AIDS
                            perspective, achieved through photographs of GAIA's recent work in
                            Africa. Through this combination, GAIA hopes to create a sense of
                            immediacy. "People will see some beautiful objects, and at the same time
                            I hope they are inspired by the work that GAIA is doing," says Nancy
                            Murray, GAIA Event Coordinator. "There is so much hopelessness that
                            surrounds us, but when you put faces to the work we do, you see that
                            these are just people being people. They have been swept up by a plague
                            beyond their scope."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This sense of hopelessness is part of what this exhibit hopes to
                            eliminate through raising awareness. "In art history, you look at art
                            from social context," explains Chin. "What social issue is more urgent
                            right now than the HIV/AIDS epidemic? Our world is a global village: some
                            of us are physicians or chairs of health organizations, but the rest of
                            us need to ask ourselves what we can do."

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
