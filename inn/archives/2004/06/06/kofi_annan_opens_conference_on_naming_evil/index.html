                            [ENS] May 4, 2004 &mdash; United Nations secretary general and Nobel peace prize winner Kofi
                            Annan
                            opened Trinity Institute's 35th national conference May 2 to a capacity
                            crowd at New York's Trinity Church, Wall Street, speaking on the notion
                            of evil in the contemporary world and highlighting the importance of
                            faith in daily life.

                        <p>
                            This year's conference, entitled 'Naming Evil: an Interfaith Dialogue,'
                            welcomed keynote speakers from the Abrahamic faiths &mdash; Jewish,
                            Christian and Muslim &mdash; to discuss and reflect upon the concept,
                            nature, meaning and ascription of evil; "to name the evils that afflict
                            us today;" and "to seek to understand their origin and to withstand their
                            power."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trinity Institute, a continuing education program for clergy and laity,
                            was founded to provide theological renewal for clergy in the Episcopal
                            Church and has since become "a think tank for exploring pieces of the
                            post-modern puzzle and trying to make sense out of a new epistemological
                            model," according to the <a target="_blank"
                                href="http://www.trininst.org/about/index.html">Institute's
                                web site</a>.

                        <h3>
                            Slippery slope
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            The Ghanaian-born Annan, a veteran of more than 30 years at the UN, said
                            that it made him feel uncomfortable referring to humans with the term
                            "evil."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "There is something about the word, when we apply it to another human
                            being, and more especially to a group of human beings, that makes me
                            uncomfortable," he said. "It is too absolute. It seems to cut off any
                            possibility of redemption, of dialogue, or even coexistence. It is the
                            moral equivalent of declaring war."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He explained that when we think of other people as evil we are on a
                            "slippery slope" that can lead to violence and murder, but stressed the
                            difficulty of avoiding its use when confronted with genocide.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Annan faced such questions when he headed the UN's peacekeeping
                            operations during the 1994 Rwandan genocide, in which Hutu extremists
                            slaughtered more than 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus. He described how
                            difficult it is to determine at which point violence becomes so
                            deliberate and systematic that to continue dialogue achieves nothing.
                            "There are times when the use of force is legitimate and necessary,
                            because it is the lesser of two evils," he said. "But the lesser of two
                            evils is still an evil, and we should not forget that."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Annan suggested that it is helpful when using the word "evil" to apply it
                            to actions rather than to people. "Of course, it is tempting, when
                            someone commits many evil acts, to say that that person is evil in
                            himself or herself. But I am not sure that it is right," he said. "I do
                            believe, very firmly, that people must be held responsible for their
                            actions? But to say that any human being is irredeemably evil in
                            himself, or herself?that is a different matter."
                        </p>
                        <h3>
                            Intolerance, exclusion the 'true evil of our time'
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            As a Christian whose faith is a crucial guiding force in his work, Annan
                            told the conference that he does not have the right to make such an
                            absolute judgment about any of his fellow human beings, however evil the
                            acts they may have committed. "I tend to think there is some evil even in
                            the best of us, and some chink of light and hope and human feeling even
                            in the worst of us," he said. "But what I am sure of is that, whatever we
                            think about individuals, we must not allow ourselves to generalize, and
                            attribute evil characteristics to whole groups of people."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Warning of the anti-religious sentiments caused by sweeping
                            generalizations and reactions, Annan said that "we must learn to see each
                            other as individuals, each with the right to define our own identity and
                            to belong to the faith or culture of our choice."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "Tolerance is essential, but it is not enough. We must be curious about
                            each others' traditions, anxious to find what is positive in them, and
                            what we can learn from them," he said. "As I understand it, that is
                            precisely the objective of your Abrahamic Program, and I salute those of
                            all three faiths who are taking part in it."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Revisiting the conference theme, Annan suggested that "if we are intent
                            on 'Naming Evil'? then let us name it as intolerance. Let us name
                            it as exclusion. Let us name it as the false assumption that we have
                            nothing to learn from beliefs and traditions different from our own.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "That, I believe, is the true evil of our time, and I urge you all to
                            join forces against it."
                        </p>
                        <h3>
                            Role of faith stressed
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Responding to questions after his address, Annan said that the
                            international community must not give up hope but persevere and come
                            together to confront such challenges as terrorism, poverty and HIV/AIDS.
                            "You would be amazed, when an individual tries to reach out, what a
                            difference they can make," he said.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Asked about the situation in the Darfur region of the Sudan, where
                            stories of 'ethnic cleansing' have been reported recently, Annan told the
                            conference that several teams have been sent to the area to see how
                            assistance can be provided to the people on the ground. "It is difficult
                            and deplorable," he said. "We will try and pull together men and women
                            from other areas. We are dealing with a covenant to ensure that we can
                            work out a political agreement."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Annan again stressed the importance of faith in informing and guiding his
                            work as secretary general of the UN and explained that it makes a
                            difference when, during his travels, people say that they are praying for
                            him.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Rev. Margaret Rose, director of women's ministries for the Episcopal
                            Church, asked Annan about the role and voice of women in some of the
                            contexts he portrayed. "They are often the ones who care for the children
                            and they suffer a lot," Annan replied. "They often have a lot to say and
                            it is important that they are integrated into the peacemaking process. If
                            you are going to reconcile at the national level you need to bring in the
                            women. They have a different attitude to men. Their influences and voices
                            are extremely important. They bring equality and a dimension to the
                            discussion that men cannot."
                        </p>
                        <h3>
                            Not whether, but how evil exists
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Following an acknowledgement of the Rev. Dan Matthews' 17-year ministry
                            as rector of Trinity Church, Wall Street, Trinity Institute's director,
                            the Rev. Fred Burnham, spoke briefly about the conference's context and
                            its exploration of evil. "Evil remains one of the most pervasive,
                            unpredictable and enigmatic forces in human life," Burnham said. "It's
                            not the reality of evil that is in question but the way we use the word.
                            It's not whether it exists but how it exists that we need to question for
                            us to fully understand. Evil is a concept that needs to be carefully
                            parsed. Let us pray that our conversations together may contribute to a
                            national dialogue that could lead to a new and constructive global
                            consciousness."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, Dr Joan Brown Campbell, director of Chautauqua Institution and
                            former General Secretary of the National Council of Churches USA, spoke
                            about the importance of interreligious dialogue in a broken world. "How
                            can we expect there to be world peace when our religions are divided?"
                            she asked. "We need to reunite as the family of Abraham."

                            The InterfaithNews.Net service ran from 2002 through 2006, hosting articles on the

                            of the site has been restored in 2021 through careful extracts from the <a

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
