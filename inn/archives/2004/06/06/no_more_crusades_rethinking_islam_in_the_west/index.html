                    <h2>No More Crusades: Rethinking Islam in the West</h2>
                    <p class="lead">Dr. Bruce B. Lawrence, a professor or religion at Duke University, writes of
                        the need to shift the Western mindset on Islam. In doing so he critiques both Christian
                        and Muslim perceptions of each other, laying out his own vision for how the religions
                        can interact more harmoniously in the future. The article concludes with a response
                        from an American Muslim and Dr. Lawrence&#39;s reply. </p>

                        <p> No enmity is natural. Each arises from a specific set of historical circumstances.
                            We in the West have fallen prey to the idea that Islam was not just a historical
                            foe but also a natural enemy of Europe and later of the West. It was not so with
                            the "red" enemy. When the Communist threat ended in 1989, the antagonism between
                            the United States and the USSR turned into a quasi-alliance. By the mid-90s there
                            was no longer a red menace; instead, there was a green enemy: Islam. Always lurking
                            in the shadows, it emerged as a real foe during the Iranian Revolution of the late
                            70s. The band of bearded ayatollahs and their leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, became
                            the clerical counterweight to a secular, pro-Western, capitalist world order. Yet
                            neither Iranians, Libyans, Lebanese, Sudanese, nor Iraqis proved to be the real
                            menace. When September 11, 2001 brought the green enemy out of the shadows and
                            into the headlines, it was a non-state Saudi related group that attacked the United
                            States in the name of Allah. Al-Qaeda seemed to justify the worst fears of crisis
                            managers and civilization watchdogs. There was an Islamic enemy, with a Saudi face
                            and modern weapons that was real and determined. September 11 seemed to confirm
                            the major theories proffered in the aftermath of the Gulf War: Samuel Huntington's
                            clash between civilizations, Bernard Lewis's replay of the Crusades, and Francis
                            Fukuyama's reemergence of fascism with an Islamic face. </p>
                        <p> Since September 11, the "Clash of Civilizations" theory has dominated and incorporated
                            all others. It seems to explain Muslim-Western hostility as both ancient and
                            irreversible.
                            It is neither. This enmity is made by humans and thus can be unmade by humans.
                            The historical events over the past millennium can and must be retold from a broader
                            perspective that includes multiple interpretations of the same events and their
                            sequels. There is no single Christian view and no single Muslim counterpart; both
                            exhibit an internal variety. </p>
                        <p> What is needed to advance beyond pseudo-dialectics and interminable warfare is
                            a double critique - internal and external - that must begin with the symbolic event
                            that haunts the memory of Christians and Muslims alike: the Crusades. The Crusades
                            began over 900 years ago and still continue today. Pope Urban II's call for Crusaders
                            in 1095 was not an isolated message from the European Middle Ages, but an awakening
                            of Christendom to the threat of Islam. To quote Pope Urban II, "In our days God
                            has fought through Christian men in Asia against the Turks and in Europe against
                            the Moors." By Crusader logic, Christians must fight on and on, in every continent
                            and in every age, against Turks, Moors, Saracens or their 21st century collective
                            successors: the Muslims. </p>
                        <h2> Protestant and Catholic Crusaders </h2>
                        <p> Who are today's Crusaders? They are both Protestant and Catholic. News headlines
                            have featured the raw provocations of evangelicals, from the Southern Baptist President
                            who derided Muhammad as a pedophile to Franklin Graham lampooning Islam as an evil,
                            misguided religion. Until 1995 the Californian Baptist minister Tim LaHaye was
                            best known for his leadership of the Christian Family movement. He has now become
                            the bestselling author of a whole line of apocalyptic fiction, including Left Behind
                            brigade. LaHaye, of course, does not project Left Behind as fiction but as fact
                            that the end will come. It will come in the near future and it will be marked by
                            a soul harvest. The few who survive the Tribulation, the AntiChrist, and the Armageddon,
                            will be saved, while the rest will be condemned to eternal hellfire. </p>
                        <p> What does all this have to with Islam? Ostensibly nothing. The goal of the Christian
                            Right is purely religious: to reclaim Jerusalem for the Jewish people, as in the
                            1999 title of sixth installment of Left Behind: <em>Assassins: Assignment Jerusalem,
                                Target Antichrist</em>. Yet the fact behind this fictional account involves real
                            people. The real people to be targeted are Arabs. It is Arabs who occupy Jerusalem
                            and mark it as the territory of the Antichrist. It is the Arabs who represent the
                            forces of evil. It is Arabs who have to be killed in the Battle of Armageddon.
                            Only with the removal of the Arab/Muslim beast can the Holy Land be reclaimed for
                            the People of God. </p>
                        <p> By comparison to Protestant doomsday sayers, Catholic sabre rattlers may seem
                            almost anodyne in their view of both the last days and Arab adversaries. But are
                            they? Consider the Vatican. It has often been suggested that the current Pope is
                            well disposed to Muslims in general and to Palestinians in particular. But Papal
                            pronouncements also include beatifications; one recent beatification, announced
                            in April 2003, elevated an obscure Capuchin monk/priest named Marco d'Aviano. Brother
                            Marco is alleged to have inspired the now famous cappuccino coffee, but he was
                            also a seventeenth century Capuchin monk, and he helped to defend Vienna against
                            a Turkish assault in the 1680s. The Turks were Muslims and they were allegedly
                            defeated because Brother Marco rallied both Protestants and Catholics to oppose
                            the Muslim invaders. The Turks, defeated in the 1683 Battle of Vienna, never again
                            besieged Western Europe. In his April pronouncement Pope John Paul II celebrated
                            that moment as a Christian victory. He lauded Brother Marco as a true Crusader,
                            asserting that he had helped defend the "freedom and unity of Christian Europe,"
                            reminding
                            today's Catholics that the continent is founded on "common Christian roots." The
                            Holy Father's commendation had an unspoken trailer: "Muslims are not welcome; go
                            home, to Asia or to Africa, but depart from Christian Europe!" </p>
                        <p> Beyond papal pronouncements there are Catholic polemicists at large. William
                            F. Buckley leads the pack. No sooner had the U.S. completed its invasion of Iraq
                            than Buckley wrote a provocative article for The National Review (27 May 2003).
                            It was entitled "Onward, Christian Missionaries!" echoing the words of the 19th
                            century Anglican hymn, "Onward, Christian Soldiers!" In the article Buckley declared
                            that in present day Iraq, Protestant missionaries are right to tell Christian men
                            and women "to spend their lives, and even to risk them to pass on the word of the
                            Christian faith." A special difficulty, laments Buckley, "is that the moderate
                            Muslim voice arouses the antagonism of the militant, which antagonism seeks
                            satisfaction,
                            from time to time, in mayhem. The wrath of the militants is feared not only by
                            non-militant exegetes of the Koran, entire governments are intimidated." The only
                            safe haven for moderate, as for militant, Muslims is conversion to Christianity. </p>
                        <h2> Islamist rhetoric as Crusader logic </h2>
                        <p> Crusades are reciprocal warfare: Crusader logic is matched by Islamist, or Islamic
                            extremist, rhetoric. Islamists claim to speak on behalf of eternal Qu'ranic values,
                            even though they do not speak for all Muslims, nor do they speak in unity. Militant
                            Muslims are a fractious minority. The sine qua non of Islamic belief is "No god
                            but God, Muhammad is the messenger of God." Once a person has made that affirmation
                            with total sincerity, he or she becomes a Muslim. For most Muslims, the very next
                            obligations after professing faith are peaceful: prayer, fasting, almsgiving and
                            perhaps pilgrimage. Islamic observance is a rigorous daily regimen, yet for the
                            militant minority of Muslims, it is not enough to say "No god but God." For the
                            militant Muslim minority, the necessary sequel to professing the faith is defending
                            the faith. Instead of daily prayer, almsgiving, fasting or pilgrimage, the next
                            step required of all believers in Allah and his last prophet, Muhammad, is to wage
                            war, holy war, or jihad. </p>
                        <p> Militant Muslims are in effect Crusaders for Allah. They are everything to the
                            Crusaders that the Crusaders are to them: unflinching warriors of the faith. They
                            embrace the term jihad as holy war. They project themselves as holy warriors. Other
                            Muslims contest that definition of jihad as too narrow and bellicose. Yet militant
                            Muslims prize jihad as the flip side of faith. First you believe, and then you
                            fight for what you believe. Holy war must be waged against all unbelievers. This
                            is the model and the legacy of the earliest Muslims. Those who first accepted God's
                            revelation to Muhammad and became Muslims were compelled to wage war against their
                            adversaries. They fought to ensure the toehold of Islam in Arabia. For militant
                            Muslims, there is no separation between 7th century Arabia and 21st century America.
                            Both are marked as realms of ignorance. Both are battlegrounds, pitting good against
                            evil, them against us. </p>
                        <p> And so the creed of Crusaders - to kill the infidel Saracens - is matched by
                            the creed of militant Muslims - to kill the infidel Christians. Both creeds attract
                            warriors for the faith and each side is willing to preach and to act on behalf
                            of their sacred trust against all enemies. Their enemies are not just outside others;
                            they are also internal dissenters. Indeed, it is the internal dissenters who are
                            the most dangerous. For militant Muslims, as for Christian Crusaders, the first
                            task is to confront co-religionists who claim to be believers but are unwilling
                            to fight for the faith. They are viewed as hypocrites, backsliders, heretics. </p>
                        <p> If religion is about peace, neither Crusaders nor their Muslim counterparts are
                            religious. They seek war, not peace. The cardinal tenets of apocalypticism are
                            war in the name of God, my faith over your faith, the end of the world in our lifetime.
                            They will not go away soon. And in the aftermath of September 11, currents of religious
                            hatred and violence that threaten to engulf our world seem to justify fear of Muslims,
                            and to mark Muslim fanatics as the enemy auguring the end of time </p>
                        <p> We need to have religion unshackled from dyads and diatribes. We need to move
                            beyond proclaiming the end of the world as certain because God decreed its end,
                            and instead consider making the world a better place for pagans as well as pietists,
                            for Muslims, Jews, and Christians, but also for Buddhists, Hindus and Sikhs. Why?
                            Because Mystery is the first and last name of the divine and demanding humility
                            rather than hubris is the litmus test of faith. The true problem is neither Islam
                            nor Christianity; the enemies are not those who identify as Muslims or Christians.
                            The enemies are those who claim religion as the basis for conflict, faith as the
                            motive for violence, and Armageddon as the outcome of war. The enemies are the
                            militant defenders of the faith, at once blinkered and blinded to divine mystery.
                            It is not a mock war, but rather a serious, protracted war, and those on the sidelines
                            need to move beyond their own religious labels and grapple with the militants of
                            both camps, reclaiming a truth, which is also a truce, beyond their grasp. </p>
                        <h2> Beyond Crusades and Crusaders </h2>
                        <p> Since September 11 images of Islam have proliferated in the media in the United
                            States. The very act of bombing the World Trade Center and the Pentagon was theater.
                            Those planes were meant not only to destroy buildings and to kill people, but also
                            to send a message to the largest possible audience through modern media. The message
                            was as stark as it was simple: the United States is the enemy of Islam, and the
                            core of the United States is business that is privileged by the capitalist world
                            system. And so the attack on the United States had to be an attack on its core,
                            its center: the World Trade Center. </p>
                        <p> The print and TV and cyber media have all dutifully gotten the message. It would
                            be impossible to catalogue all the ways in which Islam has become an evil religion,
                            and Muslims the enemy of the US since September 11. But the most thought provoking
                            essay has come from a leftist turned social critic, Paul Berman. Berman's essay "The
                            Philosopher of Islamic Terror" appeared as the New York Times Magazine's lead story
                            on March 23, 2003. It focused exclusively on the lessons to be learned from a single
                            dissident Egyptian scholar and activist, Sayyid Qutb. According to Berman, the
                            power of Qutb's prose derives from his mixed education, which combined traditional
                            religious training in Egypt with modern secular education, including a stay in
                            the U.S. during the late 40s when he earned his M.A. from the Colorado State College
                            of Education. Berman touches on many issues, but he keeps returning to the central
                            difference between East and West: unlike their US enemies, Muslim zealots have
                            no fear of death; in fact, they welcome death, especially the death of martyrdom. "The
                            death of those who are killed for the cause of God gives more impetus to the cause,
                            which continues to thrive on their blood," writes Qutb. "Their influence on those
                            they leave behind also grows and spreads. Thus after their death they remain an
                            active force in shaping the life of their community and giving it direction. It
                            is in this sense that such people, having sacrificed their lives for the sake of
                            God, retain their active existence in everyday life. There is no real sense of
                            loss in their death, since they continue to live." </p>
                        <p> For Berman the martyrdom logic of Qutb is not just scriptural, based on an
                            interpretation
                            of certain verses from the Holy Qur'an. It is also cultural, reinforced by political
                            events of the past fifty years. While Bin Laden and his suicide warriors came from
                            Saudi Arabia, their broader roots came from Egypt via Afghanistan. Al- Qaeda, notes
                            Berman, was created in the late 1980's by an affiliation of three armed factions
                            - bin Laden's circle of Afghan Arabs, together with two factions from Egypt, the
                            Islamic Group and Egyptian Islamic Jihad, the latter led by Dr Ayman al-Zawahiri,
                            Al Qaeda's top theoretician. The Egyptian factions emerged from a school of thought
                            within Egypt's fundamentalist movement, the Muslim brotherhood, in the 1950s and
                            60s. At the heart of that single school of thought stood, until his execution in
                            1966, a philosopher named Sayyid Qutb - the intellectual hero of every one of the
                            groups that eventually went into Al Qaeda, their Karl Marx (to put it that way),
                            their guide. </p>
                        <p> Berman has no answer for the martyrdom logic of Qutb. "The terrorists speak insanely
                            of deep things," he laments. "The antiterrorists had better speak sanely of equally
                            deep things. Presidents will not do this. Presidents will dispatch armies, or decline
                            to dispatch armies, for better and for worse." It is left to philosophers and religious
                            leaders to speak up, loud and clear. The challenge, in other words, is to articulate
                            what it means to be antiterrorist, to defend religion as a force for collective
                            good and preservation of life, and not as a motive for violent destruction and
                            the end of the world. We must be willing to engage the enemy, and to fight the
                            real enduring battle of ideas. </p>
                        <p
                            style="float: right; width: 200px; font-size: larger; font-style: oblique; margin-left: 10px; color: navy;">
                            To
                            fight a war to end war, the contestants must gather like-minded Muslims, Christians,
                            Jews and Buddhists together against other religionists equally drawn to divine
                            guidance but mistakenly intent on apocalyptic doomsday brands of scriptural truth. </p>
                        <p> Berman's diagnosis is apt but it needs a prescriptive sequel. If the real battle
                            is the battle of ideas, then surely there must be Muslim warriors who also join
                            in this combat. To fight a war to end war, the contestants must gather like-minded
                            Muslims, Christians, Jews and Buddhists together against other religionists equally
                            drawn to divine guidance but mistakenly intent on apocalyptic doomsday brands of
                            scriptural truth. </p>
                        <p> In this anti-Armageddon battle a formidable Muslim warrior is the Shi'i activist
                            and university professor, Abdul Aziz Sachedina. For Sachedina, as for a growing
                            number of Muslim pluralists, the Qur'an must be read as a whole book of coherent
                            intent and not as a scrapbook of conflicting messages. The largest intent is inclusive:
                            to marshal all humankind on the path to peace, and that message prevails despite
                            the contexts of aggression that evoked Chapters 8 and 9. The <em>Qur'an</em> presents
                            Islam as the affirmation and the summation, not the denial, of earlier religions.
                            Even later Medinan Chapters declare that Muslims have no monopoly on divine grace,
                            either in this world or the next (2:62, 5:69); they also invite Jews and Christians
                            to join Muslims in emphasizing the essential similarities in their beliefs (e.g.,
                            3:64). </p>
                        <p> In his most recent book, <em>The Islamic Roots of Democratic Pluralism</em>(Oxford
                            2002), Sachedina shows how Qur'anic ideals are formulated and also how historical
                            developments rather than initial intent has limited their application. Again and
                            again, the key interpretive move is not to dwell on individual verses but to read
                            and understand all verses in their full context. To counter the verses used by
                            medieval jurists to rationalize discrimination against non-Muslims, Sachedina discloses
                            how the <em>Qur'an</em> projects an overriding concern with justice, as in the
                            following passage: </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p> God does not forbid you, with regard to those who do not fight you because
                                of your faith, nor drive you out of your homes, from dealing kindly and justly
                                with them, for God loves those who are just (60:8). </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p> The linchpin of Qur'anic logic is the universal scope of humanity. There may
                            be separate tribes and languages, races and polities, yet all humankind was created
                            to be one community, linked together and sustained by prophecy: </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p> The people were one community (<em>umma</em>), then God sent forth the Prophets,
                                good tidings to bear and warning, and He sent down with them the Book with the
                                truth, that He might decide among them touching their difference. (2:213) </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p> Difference is therefore not social waywardness, but divine prescription. Within
                            the overarching notion of a common community, above all marked through Abraham,
                            the Transcendent intended there to be differences among the children of Abraham,
                            Jews, Christians and Muslims. Those who could have been one united community are
                            instead destined to be linked communities, each with its own law and its own way,
                            in order that God might be the judge. In the meantime, believers are instructed
                            not to fight each other, but to compete with one another in good works. </p>
                        <h2> Looking Ahead </h2>
                        <p> In all, there are three broadly divergent perspectives that claim the mantle
                            of Muslim legitimacy. First, there are the ones whom Berman and other media mavens
                            depict as the militants. For them Islam is self-empowerment in a world where Muslims
                            are bereft of power. They invoke links to a scripturalist purity that they alone
                            defend; they assert its truth in order to confront a shattered present with apocalyptic
                            solutions. Only Armageddon is the answer, the route is different but the answer
                            is the same, for Muslim terrorists as for their Christian counterparts. Second,
                            there are devout Muslims who do identify with their own past but see that past
                            as sacrosanct and not subject to debate or to change. Democracy for them is a Western
                            power play, human rights are a US-backed ploy of the United Nations, women's liberation
                            or feminism is an American subversion of Muslim women's dignity. These traditionalists
                            are no less anti-American than terrorists, but they are opposed to physical violence
                            or armed conflict except when authorized by extant Muslim governments. And finally,
                            there are pluralists. Are they a minority? Perhaps. But they are not a belligerent
                            minority like the Jihadists or Islamic extremists. Sachedin, with other Muslim
                            pluralists, prize universal values, ascribing them to Qur'anic sources and applying
                            them to contemporary contexts. The pluralists may be in the minority of all Muslim
                            spokesmen but they are a zealous, restless minority. We do need religious voices
                            to speak to the current fault line between East and West, Islam and America, and
                            it is Muslim pluralists who are the philosophers and religious thinkers with whom
                            non-Muslim others can and should make common cause. </p>
                        <p> To make a plural world safe both for democratic citizens and religious rivals
                            demands nothing less than a hardy inter-faith coalition of good-willed Abrahamic
                            advocates. The only victory that counts in the war on terror will come off the
                            battlefield, in the minds and hearts of moral combatants who recognize their internal
                            enemies as well as their external foes. All those who seek to be winners in this,
                            the ultimate war must first acknowledge the power of Crusader logic: Catholic
                            irredentism
                            remains the clone of Protestant rapturism, and both are reinforced by media negativity
                            as well as by political expediency re Islam and the Muslim world. These institutional
                            blockages limit the vistas for spiritual utopianism. Without attention to the fault
                            lines of human caprice, including those within the churches, there can be neither
                            peace nor its necessary concomitant, sustained Muslim-Christian cooperation, which
                            also includes Jews and Buddhists along with others dedicated to pursuit of the
                            collective good. It is a jihad, in the truest sense, a struggle against our own
                            demons as well as others. It prohibits a Crusade. Indeed, it will only succeed
                            when Crusades, Crusaders and Crusading have been understood for what they are:
                            a bygone chapter of world history not to be repeated, except as a cautionary tale,
                            for our own and for all future generations. </p>

                                logic from someone as good hearted as the questioner appears to be. My point,
                                which is echoed again and again in many circles (Omid Safi, <em>Progressive

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
