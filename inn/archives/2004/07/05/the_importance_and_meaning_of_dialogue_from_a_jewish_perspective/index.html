                    <p class="author">By Yehuda Stolov, Interfaith Encounter Association</p>
                    <p class="postdate">Monday 05 July @ 20:27:38 </p>
                    <div class="entry">
                        <p> On Wednesday, 23 June, the <a target="_blank"
                                href="http://www.interfaith-encounter.org/">Interfaith
                                Encounter Association</a> organized, at the request of several of its activists,
                            an intra-Jewish meeting with Rabbi Shear Yashuv Cohen, Chief Rabbi of Haifa that
                            also has longtime interfaith experience, in order to learn the importance and
                            meaning of interfaith dialogue from an inner Jewish perspective. </p>
                        <p> Some eighteen people gathered in our small office. The Rabbi opened with an introduction
                            and then responded to questions. In the following lines you can find the main points
                            that were discussed. </p>
                        <p> There is a basic hesitation in the Jewish mind towards interfaith dialogue and
                            relations - as a result of the unfortunate history, in which the relations took
                            the form of debates, always initiated by the ruling religion for the purpose of
                            conversion, many times followed by coercion. The reality now is very different
                            as there is no fear from coerced conversions. Moreover, there is openness to learn
                            from the light of the Torah and we should spread it to "prepare the path for the
                            Messiah" as says Maimonides. The Rabbi described a letter that he received from
                            another Rabbi, who criticized him for his role as the Chair of the Committee of
                            the Chief Rabbinate for dialogue with the Catholic Church. The Rabbi replied that
                            looking at the prayer of "Aleynu Leshabe'ach" - our emphasis now is less on the
                            first part, that looks for the dangers and negates other religions, but on the
                            second part, that stresses our vision for the coming time when "And the LORD shall
                            be King over all the earth; in that day shall the LORD be One, and His name one". </p>
                        <p> In the Catholic Church there was a major change that is no less than a revolution,
                            with the second Vatican Council. As a result of the Holocaust the Church introspected
                            at the Christian climate in Europe that helped make it possible and revised its
                            teachings. The present Pope implemented extensively the decisions of that council,
                            saying that God does not take back his gifts - therefore Jews should be respected
                            as they are the older brothers of the Christians. </p>
                        <p> Rabbi Soloveichik, in his famous article "Confrontation", outlined the limits
                            of Jewish-Christian dialogue by encouraging the advancement of joint social action
                            and the negation of theological debates about who is right and who is wrong. </p>
                        <p> In Islam the faith is one God is very pure and there are no theological challenges.
                            The problem here is the lack of a strong Islamic leadership that will counter effectively
                            those groups that interpret Islam in a militant way. </p>
                        <p> It is important that we come to the dialogue with self-esteem and with knowledge
                            and acknowledgement of our sources and what we have to offer to the dialogue. Both
                            should go together: self respect and respect for the other. </p>
                        <p> In occasions of joint prayers the Rabbi recommended reading Psalms. He also described
                            the practice in St. Edijio where the Jews go to the Synagogue, the Christians to
                            the Church and the Muslims to the Mosque. After each finishes their prayers, they
                            go out with their prayer costumes and walk jointly for peace. </p>
                        <p> The Rabbi concluded with a quote from his speech at the ceremony of ordination
                            of young rabbis, from which he came to our meeting. The Midrash says that Moses
                            was selected to be the leader after he went out of his way to take care for a lamb
                            that was lost from the herd. The Rabbi told the new young rabbis that the leader
                            is like a shepherd and as such his ultimate test is not the treatment of those
                            who stay within the herd but how the treatment of those who run away from it and
                            go astray. </p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
