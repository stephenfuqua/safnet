                    <h2>Americans Believe Religious Differences are Biggest Challenge to World Peace</h2>
                    <p class="lead">A new survey from ReachingCommonGround.com and Harris Interactive finds that a
                        majority of adult Americans believe that religious differences are the biggest
                        obstacle in the face of achieving world peace, translating this belief into a call
                        for greater respect for other religions in institutional religious education. The
                        survey also finds that religious tolerance is strongly correlated to age. The article
                        also announces an essay competition for youth, with &#x0024;100,000 worth of prizes.
                        <i>[Editorial
                            note: what does &#8220;take the time to learn about other religions&#8221; really mean
                            for
                            these folks? Am I just jaded that I don&#39;t believe that 59% of adults actually know
                            anything substantial about a religion other than their own?]</i> </p>

                        <p> Boston, June 23, 2004 - A scientific survey conducted by Harris Interactive? from
                            May 25-27, 2004 determined that the majority of adult Americans (69 percent) believe
                            that religious differences are the biggest hurdle to achieving global peace. </p>
                        <p> While opinions appeared to be mixed as to how tolerant Americans feel they are
                            when it comes to religious views other than their own (only 46 percent considered
                            Americans very tolerant), nearly three in five (59%) said that they personally
                            take the time to learn about other religions. More than two-thirds of Americans
                            (69 percent) were in favor of having their children learn about other faiths in
                            their chosen house of worship, and half (50%) said they actively teach their children
                            to respect other faiths. </p>
                        <p> The survey was sponsored by <a
                                class="dead-link" title="This link is no longer available.">ReachingCommonGround.com</a>,
                            a nonprofit organization started this year to foster understanding and dialogue
                            among people of different faiths, with an initial focus on Christians and Jews.
                            The initiative was founded by 25-year-old Elizabeth Goldhirsh, a magazine heiress
                            and graduate student in theological studies at Harvard University, in memory of
                            her parents. Goldhirsh teamed up with Baltimore's Institute for Christian &amp; Jewish
                            Studies to launch Reaching Common Ground in the wake of the immense tension created
                            between Christians and Jews by Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ. </p>
                        <p> The survey found that 78 percent of U.S. adults believe that Christians and Jews
                            can find common ground between their faiths to develop a mutually respectful relationship.
                            Goldhirsh hopes to cultivate this belief into a stronger understanding between
                            the two faiths. </p>
                        <p> "While the media often focus on conflicts between the faiths, the major religions
                            have more in common than most realize," explains Goldhirsh. "It is our hope to
                            use the religious values, beliefs, and experiences that we do share to help forge
                            a better understanding among people of all faiths." </p>
                        <p> To promote interfaith understanding, ReachingCommonGround.com has also launched
                            an essay competition for students 16-22 years of age. This contest offers young
                            scholars $100,000 in prize money for essays illuminating the common origins and
                            spiritual bonds between Christianity and Judaism. The grand prize is $25,000. Contest
                            winner will also be eligible for a number of fellowships awarded by the Institute
                            for Christian &amp; Jewish Studies. There is no entry fee, and the essays must
                            be no longer than 2,500 words and written in English. The official rules are posted
                            on the group's Web site, <a
                            class="dead-link" alt="This link is no longer available.">www.ReachingCommonGround.com</a>,
                            and entries must be submitted no later than July 30, 2004. </p>
                        <p> The competition is being administered and judged by The Institute for Christian &amp; Jewish
                            Studies (<a href="http://www.icjs.org/">www.icjs.org</a>). ICJS addresses the contemporary
                            challenges of religious pluralism by helping to shape a more productive relationship
                            between Christians and Jews. </p>
                        <h3> Other Factors in Religious Tolerance </h3>
                        <p> Interestingly, the survey found that older Americans tend to be more open to
                            and interested in other faiths. Americans 45 years and older are more likely to
                            take the time to learn about different religions. Nearly two in three adults in
                            the 45-54 age bracket (63%) and the 55+ age bracket (64%) said they take time to
                            teach their children about other faiths versus 30% of the 18-34 bracket and 48%
                            of the 35-44 bracket. Similarly, 73% of the 45-54 bracket and 79% of the 55+ bracket
                            believe their church or synagogue should teach children about other faiths whereas
                            only 58% of the 18-34 bracket and 65% of the 35-44 bracket agreed. </p>
                        <p> Another age-related aspect is the way Americans feel about religious tolerance.
                            Fifty-eight percent of the 55+ bracket believe that Americans are very tolerant
                            of different religious perspectives while only 38% of the 18-34 bracket felt so. </p>
                        <p> Older Americans are also more likely to believe that religious differences are
                            the biggest hurdle to global peace. Yet they seem to have more faith in our ability
                            to overcome these differences, with more than four in five adults in the 45-54
                            bracket (84%) and 55+ bracket (82%) believing that Christians and Jews can find
                            a common ground for a respectful relationship compared to only 72 percent of the
                            18-34 bracket and 75 percent of the 35-44 bracket. </p>
                        <h3> Survey Methodology </h3>
                        <p> The survey was conducted online by Harris Interactive from May 25-27, 2004 using
                            a nationwide sample of 2,148 U.S. adults. The data were weighted to be representative
                            of the total U.S. adult population on the basis of region, age within gender, education,
                            household income, and race/ethnicity. The margin of error for the total sample
                            is plus or minus 2.1 percentage points. Data tables are available in the pressroom

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
