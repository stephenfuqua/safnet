                    <h2>Teens from Regions of Conflict Gather to Learn to Use Religion for Peace</h2>
                    <p class="author">By Auburn Theological Seminary</p>
                    <p class="postdate">Monday 05 July @ 19:59:44 </p>
                    <div class="entry">
                        <p> June 28, 2004 &mdash; On June 27, more than 50 teens from the Middle East, Northern
                            Ireland, South Africa and the United State &mdash; Muslims, Christians, and Jew &mdash; will
                            gather in upstate New York for the fourth year of Face to Face/Faith to Faith,
                            an international, multifaith youth leadership program. Face to Face aims to develop
                            a new generation of leaders who have the capacity to negotiate the challenges and
                            opportunities of a multifaith global society. The program is rooted in the belief
                            that young people of diverse backgrounds can find common ground despite the differences
                            of religion and culture. </p>
                        <p> The students, ages 16-18, are participants in this program co-sponsored by New
                            York's Auburn Theological Seminary, a pioneer in multi-faith programming, in partnership
                            with Seeking Common Ground, a Denver-based peace organization which has sponsored
                            programs for youth in the Middle East and the United States for more than a decade. </p>
                        <p> While people of all faiths agree that violence and conflict in the name of religion
                            are regrettable, faith groups have often remained quiet or even suppressed those
                            who question the use of violence "in God's name." The events of September 11th
                            and ongoing conflicts in places such as Iraq make the need for this program more
                            urgent than ever. For many of the participants, it will be the first trip outside
                            their home countries, their first experience of New York City, and &mdash; most importantly
                            &mdash; their
                            first encounter with the "other." </p>
                        <p> During their July 4th visit to New York City, the teens will put faith into action
                            at a service project addressing homelessness, coordinated by the Quaker nonprofit
                            Youth Services Opportunities Program (YSOP). They will also explore larger contexts
                            for peace work with scholars and activists such as South Africa's Farid Esack;
                            Julio Medina of the Exodus Transitional Community, and Danielle Celermajer of Columbia's
                            Center for the Study of Human Rights. Worship at selected "sacred spaces" &mdash; Jumma
                            at the 96th Street Mosque, Shabbat at Congregation Rodeph Sholom, and Sunday services
                            at the Brick Presbyterian Church, for example &mdash; will allow them to be "good
                            neighbors" in faith. </p>
                        <p> Face to Face unfolds in two phases. The intensive two-week summer curriculum
                            upstate combines religious study and exploration of sacred texts, communication
                            skills, leadership, and peace-building workshops. In this safe space, which a Northern
                            Ireland teen called "a little piece of heaven," participants learn to trust themselves
                            and others, building friendships through group sports, arts projects, and the simple
                            tasks of living and working together in community. Visits from artists, storytellers,
                            musicians, and filmmakers encourage further self-discovery and expression. Exposure
                            to religious and public leaders also offers the youth a glimpse into their own
                            roles in shaping a more just future. </p>
                        <p> Participants are committed to the program for at least one year, and follow a
                            structured course back home. The on-line curriculum keeps the dialogue moving,
                            and email sustains relationships with new friends from around the world. A "home
                            group leader," who accompanied them to the summer program, guides the development
                            of social action projects in education and volunteerism. </p>
                        <p> And the program's effects ripple outward. Parents of alumni from South Africa
                            and Israel, for example, who have witnessed their children's "voyage in human
                            understanding," have
                            even formed interfaith groups themselves for their own growth and to support their
                            children's efforts. </p>
                        <p> In the words of one participant, "It's hard to change the world!" Yet more than
                            200 teens over the past four years have found the courage to try. They are chosen
                            especially from areas of the world where the use of religion as a means of oppression
                            is all too common. Having witnessed faith and belief co-opted for destructive ends,
                            they learn how these can and should instead be used constructively: for making
                            peace. Co-founder and long-time peace activist Melodye Feldman says that through
                            active, intentional listening and honest dialogue, participants learn how to understand
                            the other and see humanity there. "We are teaching them how to tell, and listen
                            to, passionate points of view." Executive Vice President of Auburn Theological
                            Seminary, Presbyterian minister, and fellow founder Katharine Henderson adds, "The
                            mission is to appreciate the other's perspective." A New York alumnus concludes, "It
                            is the most powerful thing I have experienced." </p>
                        <p> Face to Face/Faith to Faith runs June 27 through July 12 at the Presbyterian
                            Camp and Conference Center in Holmes, New York and in New York City. For more information

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
