                            Global PeaceWorks is an organization that arranges for people of many
                            faiths to live and work together for two weeks, creating a model of
                            peace. In December they sojourned together in East Delhi, India, joining
                            together for talks from dignataries such as His Holiness the Dalai Lama
                            and the Honorable President of India, volunteered in direct service to
                            local communities; visited temples from several different faith
                            traditions, and joined together in prayer and reflection. Thirty
                            volunteers from nine different countries participated in the event.

                        <p>
                            When Hindus and Muslims faced each other in a communally charged
                            neighborhood in East Delhi in December, they looked at each other and&hellip;
                            smiled. Then they said prayers in Hindi and Arabic and went to work with
                            Sikhs, Buddhists, Christians, and Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;s as volunteers in
                            service to a community in need.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The volunteers were invited by Global PeaceWorks - an organization that
                            arranges for people of many faiths to live and work together for two
                            weeks, creating a model of peace.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the evenings, they heard religious leaders and statesmen like His
                            Holiness the Dalai Lama and the Honorable President of India Dr. A.P.J.
                            Abdul Kalam at the Delhi Peace Summit, but in the mornings, this group
                            was off to Janta Colony in Jaffarabad to serve the local people by
                            building a community center.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This diverse group of thirty volunteers from nine nations lived together
                            as an international family. They supported the Delhi Peace Summit
                            interfaith conference by presenting prayers of six traditions at the
                            opening session on Youth and the Culture of Peace, then, following Dr.
                            Jerry Chang of Humanity United Globally, the group facilitated
                            discussions on interfaith cooperation.
                        </p>
                        <p> The core work of Global PeaceWorks is to provide &#8220;cooperative interfaith
                            service to people in need&#8221; &mdash; a task that program director Eric
                            Wenzel says is needed to complement traditional interfaith dialogue
                            meetings. In this case, Janta Colony, Jaffarabad which had a history of
                            problems between Muslims and Hindus, was selected. There the group worked
                            with Chetanalaya, the social action NGO of the Catholic Diocese of New
                            Delhi, and its representative Anthony David, a tireless man devoted to
                            serving people and uplifting the community.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The volunteers supported the Muslim and Hindu families in Janta colony.
                            Together representatives of each religion laid the foundation stones for
                            a new community center and worked with a shared vision of peaceful
                            cooperation and community improvements. Additionally, Global PeaceWorks
                            interfaith volunteer teams of Hindu, Muslim, Christian and Sikh visited
                            homes to listen to concerns and share a vision of peace. &#8220;There is no
                            outer peace without inner peace, so we need to work with people of faith&#8221;
                            remarked project coordinator Khorrum Omer, a Muslim from New Delhi.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To complement the charity work, the volunteers visited religious sites
                            including the famous Sis Ganj Gurudwara, the Jama Masjid and Shahi
                            Masjid, Mother Theresa&#39;s Sisters of Charity, the Laxmi Narayan Hindu
                            Temple and The Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; House of Worship.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The experience was enhanced by visits with Dr. Mufti Mukarram Ahmed, Imam
                            of the Shahi Masjid, India&#39;s second largest mosque; Dharma Master Hsin
                            Tao of the Museum of World Religions; peace activist Ela Gandhi,
                            granddaughter of Mahatma Gandhi; Dilip Kolhatkar of the Everest Peace
                            Project; Baba Virsa Singh Ji of Gobind Sadan; devotees from Sri Sri Ravi
                            Shankar&#39;s Art of Living Foundation; the Central Baptist Church and a
                            community Gurudwara.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A day of reflection at a beautiful religious retreat south of Delhi
                            concluded this first Global PeaceWorks project which, in addition to
                            Chetanalaya, was supported by the Tribal Welfare Society, the
                            Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; House of Worship, Gobind Sadan and the Religious
                            Youth Service.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When the project started, there were Hindu and Muslim volunteers feeling
                            uncomfortable in each other&#39;s presence. When the project ended, they were
                            embracing, crying and professing their love and respect for each other.
                            Volunteer Harkirat Singh of New Delhi summed up the experience saying &#8220;I
                            never thought the day will come when I will meet so many people from
                            different religions and countries and we all will work together to have
                            peace in the world. Global PeaceWorks has totally changed my life.&#8221;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The success of this inaugural event paved the way for a second Global
                            PeaceWorks project in New Delhi to be held from Dec 30, 2004 to January
                            7, 2005.

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
