                            The bad news never seems to stop, does it? In the U.S. we find ourselves solidly embroiled
                            in the
                            nasty and contentious process of selecting the next President, even as debate rages over
                            intelligence, terrorism, and Iraq. Meanwhile, the world looks on in continuing shock, awe,
                            sadness
                            and anger at the ceaseless small-scale war in the Holy Land… and should be looking on in
                            equal
                            horror at the atrocities in places such as Sudan and Uganda.

                            We are in a desperate struggle with the forces of fanaticism, particularly that brand of
                            fanaticism
                            aided and abetted by religion. Largely in reaction to these forces, a global interfaith
                            movement has
                            sprung from the grassroots of religion and spirituality, advocating openness, diversity,
                            and, most
                            of all, peace. Still in its infancy as a vehicle for peacemaking, members within and without
                            this
                            movement struggle to understand how it can effectively wage peace in this tumultuous
                            environment.
                        </p>
                        <p>InterfaithNews.Net seeks to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive
                            interfaith and
                            religious news, events, and resources—items that, sadly, you won&#39;t see competing for
                            space in
                            the mainstream media. Even as this movement searches for the most constructive means to
                            express its
                            collective voice (if it has one), we believe the stories highlighted below are in themselves
                            solutions. And, cumulatively, perhaps we can derive from them answers to the questions of
                            how to be
                            an effective, positive, and authentic force for the promotion of the rule of love.

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
