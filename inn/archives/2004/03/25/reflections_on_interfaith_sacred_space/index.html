                    <p class="postdate">Thursday 25 March @ 20:17:32 </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        Is genuine interfaith space possible? What might a space designed to
                        accommodate the needs of all faiths look like? The first interfaith
                        sacred space competition took place in response to these questions.
                        Sponsored by the American Institute of Architects, San Francisco Chapter;
                        EURIMA (Expressing
                        the United Religions Initiative in Music and the Arts); the Interfaith
                        Center at the Presidio, and in partnership with the Council for the
                        Parliament of the World's Religions (CPWR) and the United Religions
                        Initiative (URI),
                        this competition received 159 entries from 17 countries.

                            The objectives that entrants were asked to address were:

                        <ul>
                            <li>To design a space that will:

                                    <li>Inspire people to practice their own faith traditions, alone or
                                        as a single faith group or with other faiths;
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Assure that people from all traditions will feel comfortable,
                                        welcome and respected.

                                    <li>Offer a model of interreligious cooperation

                                    </li>
                                    <li>Provide for sacred space needs for all faiths
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            This was a competition of ideas, imagination and vision. As one of ten
                            jurors, I was challenged to discover my own view of interfaith sacred
                            space. My reflections come from my interfaith heart and soul, my
                            immersion in the interfaith movement for the past twelve years, locally,
                            regionally, nationally and internationally.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The first question I asked myself was: What are the qualities of sacred
                            space?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The two qualities that occurred to me are that it's organic and it's
                            unlimited. It's organic in that you never know what's going to happen,
                            and yet something happens. It develops a life of its own. It's unlimited
                            in that it can happen in any place and at any time. The paradox for both
                            qualities is that on the one hand it can take hours and hours of planning
                            to create the environment and process to ensure safe space and on the
                            other hand it happens spontaneously.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The next question I asked myself was: How does sacred space occur in
                            daily life?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My response to this question was to first investigate secular sacred
                            space. What are the spaces and times when I have felt the presence of the
                            sacred in secular settings. Four experiences came to mind immediately.
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The Vietnam Memorial in Washington, DC. Walking up to that wall
                                evokes a presence. Something happens at that site.
                            </li>
                            <li>The gate surrounding St. Paul's Chapel opposite the World Trade
                                Center in New York City in 2002. People from around the world contributed
                                hats, posters, momentos, photos of loved ones, and words of encouragement
                                that were attached to the gate. Somehow there was a connection that
                                occured. Something happened.
                            </li>
                            <li>The Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC. Walking, almost processing,
                                through the museum leads to a sense of the sacred. Everyone is very
                                respectful, thoughtful, reverent. Something happens.
                            </li>
                            <li>The Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, CA. Walking into the concert
                                hall is breathtaking. The creativity and imagination that went into the
                                design and created a space that seats over 2,000 and yet feels intimate
                                and connecting. Something happens.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            Each of these spaces is public and secular and yet something happens when
                            you are there, experiencing the moment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The next question was: Where have you experienced interfaith sacred
                            space? Again, six experiences came to mind immediately.
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The Palmer House Hotel in Chicago in 1993 when 8,000 people from all
                                over the world and as many faith traditions as you can imagine converged
                                in this one place for the second Parliament of the World's Religions, 100
                                years after the first was held. Encounters occurred on elevators,
                                stairways, hallways, escalators, meeting rooms and the dramatic high
                                celinged lobby, that transformed people. Something happened.
                            </li>
                            <li>The high ceilinged glass enclosed rotunda of City Hall in Edmonton,
                                Canada in 1998 during the North American Interfaith Network Annual
                                Meeting when members of over 10 faith traditions offered prayers for the
                                whole community. Something happened.
                            </li>
                            <li>Processions in Cape Town, South Africa at the 1999 Parliament of the
                                World's Religions, at Stanford University for URI Summits, in Pittsburgh, PA
                                for the signing of the URI Global Charter in 2000 and in
                                Rio de Janiero, Brazil for the 1st Global Assembly of the
                                URI in 2002. In
                                each case, hundreds of people from dozens of faith traditions walked
                                together through public streets as a way of honoring the events and the
                                community. Something happened on those walks as we talked to each other
                                and to people in the community.
                            </li>
                            <li>Outdoor blessings under the sky. Many interfaith events begin with an
                                outdoor blessing, usually led by the indigenous people of the area. These
                                events evoke a special feeling of awe for the earth and all living
                                beings. They often set the tone for the rest of the gathering. Something
                                happens.
                            </li>
                            <li>On a more local note, just after 9/11 our grassroots interfaith group
                                contacted the city to offer to facilitate a vigil in honor of those who
                                died. It was held in an outdoor amphitheater of a community park. Over
                                700 people came and heard prayers from over 12 faith traditions. We
                                closed with lighting candles and singing. The park became a sacred space.
                                Something happened.
                            </li>
                            <li>Each year on January 1st, our interfaith group sponsors a
                                Peace Day event. It is held in a local church. For two or so hours we
                                invite people from diverse faith traditions to share their spiritual
                                practices with us. We sit in concentric circles with a candle in the
                                center. At the close this year we invited everyone to stand in one large
                                circle to share a final blessings. Magically the chairs were moved and we
                                were all standing together, nearly 100 of us, in this amazing circle of
                                diversity. As we looked around at each other, we all knew that something
                                special had happened. We were in sacred space.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            What does all of this say about the ingredients for Interfaith Sacred
                            Space? I think that there are four elements. First is worship space, such
                            as in an interfaith chapel. This space has to be very flexible as the
                            needs of traditions vary. Some of the considerations are: seating that
                            can be moved, no fixed orientation or altar, option to open to outdoors,
                            availability of carpets, use of candles, lights, fire, water, high

                            Second is gathering space. It is an important part of interfaith sacred
                            space to encounter others, indoors or outdoors, in small groups and large
                            groups.

                            Third is the importance of the circle as a way to gather. It is an
                            egalitarian way to meet, no one is at the head. It is reclaiming an
                            ancient way of being together.

                            processing, weaving the sacred space with the surrounding space.

                            The competition offered an opportunity for interaction between architects
                            and interfaith participants. Our differing perspectives resulted in a
                            dynamic, interesting and challenging process. Each entrant also had a
                            specific perspective on interfaith sacred space. Over the course of a
                            weekend we were able to come up with four winning designs and seven
                            honorable mentions.

                            This is just the beginning of a conversation about what makes Interfaith
                            Sacred Space. We are starting to learn what works, what supports,
                            nurtures and cultivates this kind of space. We also know that it just
                            happens when people of good will gather. Awareness is the key to the
                            unfolding of this amazing journey.

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
