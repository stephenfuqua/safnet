                        <p>
                            In a world where religiously-motivated violence is still far too
                            prevalent, religious leaders have increasingly come to understand that
                            they must be instruments for change in the world, instruments for the
                            promotion of true peace. In His Holiness John Paul II&#39;s homily on the
                            World Day of Peace He emphasized the <em>duty</em> to promote peace in
                            the world. His were not the first words on the subject from an
                            international religious leader; indeed peace has long been a theme of
                            His. Nevertheless it is a call that must needs be constantly repeated to
                            peoples who have spent millenia hearing their leaders &mdash; usually with
                            some religion &#8220;on their side&#8221; &mdash; calling for violence against &#8220;the
                            other.&#8221; Read on for excerpts from His homily and for links to peace
                            statements from other traditions.

                            Pope Says Temptation to Mistrust Must Be Overcome
                        </h3>
                        <p class="author">
                            From: <a href="http://www.zenit.org/" target="_blank">Zenit.org</a>
                        </p>
                        <p> VATICAN CITY, JAN. 1, 2004 (Zenit.org) &mdash; John Paul II started the new
                            year by insisting that peace is &#8220;possible&#8221; and thus a &#8220;duty,&#8221; and he
                            called for a new international order.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That was the focus of the Pope&#39;s homily today at the Mass to celebrate
                            the solemnity of the Mother of God. The Church also marked World Day of
                            Peace.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Holy Father concentrated on the need to teach peace, an issue he
                            highlighted in the first year of his pontificate. &#8220;Given that peace is
                            possible &mdash; I wish to repeat &mdash; it is a duty,&#8221; he explained in
                            St. Peter&#39;s Basilica.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &#8220;In the face of situations of injustice and violence that oppress various
                            areas of the planet, in the face of the permanence of armed conflicts
                            frequently forgotten by public opinion, it is ever more necessary to
                            build together paths of peace,&#8221; the Pope said. &#8220;Therefore, it is
                            indispensable to teach peace.&#8221;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He said it is particularly necessary to teach peace in the land where
                            Jesus was born, which, &#8220;unfortunately, continues to live in dramatic
                            conditions.&#8221;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &#8220;It is necessary, however, to persevere without yielding to the
                            temptation to mistrust,&#8221; the Holy Father added. &#8220;An effort is necessary
                            on the part of all to have the fundamental rights of people respected
                            through constant education in lawfulness.&#8221;
                        </p>
                        <p> &#8220;With this objective, everything possible must be done to overcome the
                            logic of strict justice in order to open also to that of forgiveness. In
                            fact, there is no peace without forgiveness,&#8221; the Pope said.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Commenting on the international scene, the Holy Father explained that
                            there is an ever-greater need for &#8220;a new international order, which will
                            make use of the experience and results obtained in these years by the
                            United Nations.&#8221;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He called for such &#8220;an order that will be capable of giving solutions
                            that are appropriate to the problems of today, based on the dignity of
                            the human person, the integral development of society, solidarity between
                            rich and poor countries, and the capacity to share the resources and
                            extraordinary results of scientific and technological progress.&#8221;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ambassadors of countries accredited to the Holy See attended the Mass,
                            which was presided over by the Holy Father and celebrated by Vatican
                            Secretary of State Cardinal Angelo Sodano.

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
