                        <p>
                            &#8220;We are gathered as peacemakers from various regions of the world to
                            launch this year-long focus in the United States by lifting up the legacy
                            of Martin Luther King Jr, whose work and ministry has inspired
                            peacemakers around the globe,&#8221; said Rev. Leonid Kishkovsky, archpriest,
                            Orthodox Church in America, and moderator, US Conference of the
                            WCC, in opening
                            remarks at the service.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In a multimedia presentation, members of the congregation watched graphic
                            images of violence, destruction, and war on a large screen as
                            DOV coordinator
                            Rev. Hansulrich Gerber presented the <a href="#goals">goals of the Decade
                                to Overcome Violence</a>, which is to be one of &#8220;Churches Seeking
                            Reconciliation and Peace&#8221;.
                        </p>
                        <h3>
                            No justice, no peace
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            &#8220;It is a contradiction of life to put peace ahead of justice,&#8221; said the
                            Rev. Dr Otis Moss, the pastor of the Olivet Institutional Baptist Church
                            in Cleveland, Ohio, in introductory remarks in his sermon. &#8220;There will be
                            no international peace until there is international justice,&#8221; he said,
                            quoting Israel&#39;s first prime minister, David Ben Gurion.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Moss, a friend and associate of the Rev. Dr Martin Luther King Jr, urged
                            members of the congregation never to forget the lessons of history as
                            they pursue both peace and justice. &#8220;To forget is exile,&#8221; he said, &#8220;to
                            remember is redemption.&#8221; Moss warned the congregation to never forget
                            &#8220;the moans and groans of countless millions of human beings&#8221; who were
                            imprisoned on slave ships and &#8220;who were fed to sharks if they died on
                            passage, or served up to slave masters if they survived.&#8221;
                        </p>
                        <p> Yet Moss also cited some redemptive historical developments during the
                            past half-century, including the passage of the GI Bill in 1944, that
                            opened educational and career opportunities to millions of disadvantaged
                            veterans. In addition, he said that the establishment of the United
                            Nations and the World Council of Churches were important international
                            milestones on the way to universal peace and justice.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Moss also pointed to national and international liberation movements &mdash;
                            beginning with the independence of India in 1947 &mdash; as redemptive signs.
                            &#8220;When India gained independence, the British Empire had a nervous
                            breakdown and the rest of western colonialism had a heart attack,&#8221; Moss
                            said.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All of these significant historic developments, Moss said, were the
                            context in which King found his prophetic vocation.
                        </p>
                        <h3>
                            Following Dr King&#39;s footsteps
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            &#8220;What can we do to follow in Dr King&#39;s footsteps?&#8221; Moss asked. &#8220;We
                            must
                            be about the business of building a new generation of prophets of
                            justice,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We must be disciples of love, apostles of liberation,
                            teachers of nonviolence, and ambassadors of reconciliation.&#8221;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Such endeavours, Moss said, &#8220;will not come automatically, nor without
                            institutional and individual risks.&#8221; And, he added, efforts to make peace
                            would require leaders who &#8220;have the courage to lead, to mould consensus,
                            and to act despite the risk of being persecuted.&#8221; Quoting Rabbi Abraham
                            Joshua Heschel, Moss described King&#39;s life and ministry as &#8220;a vision, a
                            voice, and a way&#8221;. He urged his listeners to &#8220;share his vision, hearken
                            to his voice, and follow in his way&#8221;.
                        </p>
                        <h3>
                            &#8220;War is obsolete&#8221;
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Citing the anti-war sentiments of several former generals in the US
                            military, Moss asked: &#8220;If generals of the army had that kind of insight,
                            then what is the excuse at the White House, or your house, or my house if
                            the occupants of those homes do not oppose war?&#8221;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &#8220;We must join with those former generals and declare that &#39;War is
                            obsolete,&#39;&#8221; Moss added. And in a reference to the war in Iraq, Moss
                            chided the Bush administration for its search for weapons of mass
                            destruction there, when there are such weapons in the US.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &#8220;Where are the weapons of mass destruction?&#8221; Moss asked. &#8220;Look around:
                            AIDS is a weapon of mass destruction,&#8221; he said, &#8220;so is hunger, the denial
                            of health care to the poor, illiterate and uneducated minds, tobacco and
                            tobacco-related illnesses, uncared-for children&#8221;. All these and many
                            other weapons destroy the fabric of the nation, Moss contended.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Efforts to pursue peace must originate &#8220;in our commitment to break the
                            bonds of injustice, and to bring justice and peace into our homes, and
                            into our collective house - the White House,&#8221; Moss concluded. &#8220;When we
                            break the bonds of injustice and oppression, then we become God&#39;s
                            peacemakers.&#8221;

                            The InterfaithNews.Net service ran from 2002 through 2006, hosting articles on the

                            of the site has been restored in 2021 through careful extracts from the <a

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
