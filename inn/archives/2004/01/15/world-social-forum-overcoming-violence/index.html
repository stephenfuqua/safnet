                        </p>
                        <p>22 January 2004 (WCC) &mdash;
                            &#8220;India is going through enormous insecurity because religion is being
                            used for violence,&#8221; Siddhartha, a member of an inter-religious group
                            working for peace and justice in Bangalore, told participants at a
                            seminar at the World Social Forum in Mumbai.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the 20 January seminar on &#8220;Religious resources to overcome violence&#8221;
                            organized by the World Council of Churches (WCC), Siddhartha gave some
                            examples of religious-instigated violence in India. Recently in Mumbai, a
                            bomb reportedly placed by Muslims exploded, killing scores of people; in
                            2003 over 2,000 Muslims were &#8220;literally massacred in Gujarat in the name
                            of religion&#8221;.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For Siddhartha, the ruling majority Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is
                            propagating a fundamentalist brand of Hinduism and relegating Muslims and
                            Christians to second-class status. &#8220;What will happen if the BJP wins the
                            election [scheduled for April this year] or is in a coalition where it
                            has more representation? How can a religion as inclusive as Hinduism
                            become so exclusive?&#8221; he asked.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On a more positive note, Siddhartha highlighted India&#39;s potential for
                            peace. He said that religious communities in the multi-religious nation
                            of over one billion people are challenged to work towards a &#8220;hermeneutic
                            of hope&#8221;, that is, to reinterpret their different religious traditions to
                            lift up the values of peace and justice in their core messages.
                        </p>
                        <p> Reviewing the Middle East situation from a Muslim perspective, Mohamed
                            Mosaad from the Egyptian chapter of the United Religions Initiative (URI)
                            emphasized the need for religious leaders to give a spiritual dimension
                            to concrete situations like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and provide
                            spiritual resources that could help resolve it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Referring to the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the US, he said
                            that there is an &#8220;apologetic Islamic discourse&#8221; which seeks to define
                            &#8220;who is right and who is wrong&#8221; and to respond to questions being raised
                            in the West about violence and Islam.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He cautioned against misrepresentation of the <i>Koran</i> in order to respond
                            to a secular situation. Mosaad suggested that Muslims should reflect on
                            how a concept like <i>Jihad</i> (holy war) used to work in the past, and how
                            it could work now. In his provocative view, while Islam is not a religion
                            of peace and love, it is a religion of fairness and justice.
                        </p>

                            The director of the Jerusalem-based Inter-faith Encounter Association
                            (IEA), Yehuda Stolov, said that like Islam, Judaism is sometimes misused
                            to suit a political situation. Inter-religious dialogue allows people to
                            co-exist without hiding their differences, but putting political issues
                            aside. Formed in 2001 by peace activists, the IEA is dedicated to
                            promoting real co-existence and peace in the Holy Land and the Middle
                            East through cross-cultural study and inter-religious dialogue.

                        <p>
                            On the topic of violence against women, LFW executive secretary for Women
                            in Church and Society, Priscilla Singh from India, presented an LFW
                            contribution to the WCC Decade to Overcome Violence. The document,
                            entitled &#8220;Churches say no to violence against women&#8221;, presents the
                            results of a world-wide survey on the issue; it affirms that violence
                            against women is a global reality even within the church.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Religion, noted Singh, usually treats women as victims, often offering
                            only a &#8220;charitable response&#8221; on an individual basis. Instead, churches
                            should tackle the issue as a whole; to do so effectively, they need to
                            see the image of God beyond gender, promote masculine models that are
                            nurturing and caring, and revision and rewrite theology with a feminist
                            perspective.
                        </p>
                        <p> Singh also called for efforts to go beyond dialogue towards concrete
                            experiences that allow a new kind of relationship between men and women
                            to develop.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Rejecting modern political &#39;messianisms&#39;, Rev. Jairo Suarez from the
                            Evangelical Lutheran Church of Colombia called for strong witness from
                            churches in the social and political sphere. The fact that fifty years of
                            civil war in his country have brought the churches together is a paradox,
                            he reflected.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ordep Trindade, a Brazilian Candombli priest, stressed the message of
                            peace as well as the ecumenical dimension of this religion, brought to
                            Brazil by African slaves.
                        </p>
                        <p> The seminar was moderated by Dr Guillermo Kerber from the WCC
                            International Relations team. In his opening remarks, Kerber suggested
                            that religion has played an ambiguous role in conflicts at the national
                            and international levels; while it has often fuelled conflicts, at other
                            times, it has made important contributions to overcoming violence.

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
