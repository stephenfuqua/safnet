                        <p>Dear Friends,</p>
                        <p>Greetings of love and peace.</p>
                        <p>I&rsquo;m delighted, once again, to urge your observance of the United Nations&rsquo;
                            International
                            Day of Peace on September 21st &ndash; an inspiring opportunity for collective
                            global action within the URI community, and in solidarity with the UN and our sisters
                            and brothers in other peace seeking organizations around the world.</p>
                        <p>The International Day of Peace was established by the UN in 1981. Originally tied
                            to the annual opening of the General Assembly, in 2001 its date was fixed annually
                            on September 21.</p>
                        <p>Certainly, there has never been a greater need for people and organizations all
                            over the world to come together for peace.</p>
                        <p>Here are three examples of how members of the URI community around the world are
                            planning to observe the International Day of Peace:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> In Columbo, Sri Lanka, the Shanti Sena CC is in the midst of a 60-day campaign
                                working in villages across the country to support the fragile peace accord
                                that promises an enduring end to Sri Lanka&rsquo;s longstanding civil war through
                                a variety of service projects and meditation/prayer for peace. This campaign
                                will culminate with a national rally for peace on September 21. The rally is
                                expected to draw 200,000 people from 15,000 villages to the capital, with simultaneous
                                gatherings as well in several villages in different parts of the country.</li>
                            <li>In Manila, Philippines,
                                the Peacebuilders CC is collaborating with other groups to sponsor a large
                                peace rally as that country seeks to build an enduring peace.</li>
                            <li> In Santiago, Chile,
                                the Foro Espiritual de Santiago por la Paz CC will hold a festival celebrating
                                interfaith work for peace and praying for the success of work for peace in
                                other parts of the world, including Sri Lanka. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If you have plans for September 21st, please let us know. If you don&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s
                            not too late to create a meaningful observance. Here are a few suggestions of how
                            you might participate:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Have a Moment of Silence for peace at 12 noon, in solidarity with the ringing
                                of the Peace Bell at the UN, and do a simple, practical act of peace to benefit
                                your local community.</li>
                            <li>Encourage local religious communities and schools to observe
                                this Moment of Silence.</li>
                            <li>Hold an International Day of Peace Vigil - a full day of spiritual observance
                                for peace. See <a href="http://www.idpvigil.com">www.idpvigil.com.</a></li>
                            <li>Plant a Peace Pole - plant a new one or re-dedicate an existing one.</li>
                            <li>Collaborate with UN offices and missions in your area in commemorating the
                                Day. See <a href="http://www.un.org/events/peaceday">www.un.org/events/peaceday.</a>
                            </li>
                            <li>Encourage your city, state, or national government to issue a proclamation
                                declaring September 21st as a day of peace, nonviolence, and cease-fire. See
                                <a href="www.internationaldayofpeace.org">www.internationaldayofpeace.org</a> for ideas.
                            </li>
                            <li>Ask your local media to publicize the International Day of Peace. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Again, on behalf
                            of URI&rsquo;s global community, I urge you to make plans to
                            join in this global observance of peace. The world needs our best. We thank you,
                            in advance, for your efforts and invite you to share your plans with the URI community.</p>
                        <p>Love,<br />
                            Charles Gibbs</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
