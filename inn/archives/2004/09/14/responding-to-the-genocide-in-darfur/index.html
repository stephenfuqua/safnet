                        <p>Just as a negotiated-peace began to take hold in southern Sudan, a new crisis arose in the
                            western Darfur region this past winter and spring. Half a year after escalation of the
                            atrocities, estimates of the dead range from 30,000 to 50,000, and well over a million
                            people have been internally or externally displaced. Men and boys have been systematically
                            murdered; worse yet, a conscious effort at genocide has once again turned to mass rape of
                            the remaining women. International response has been harsh yet guarded, and far too slow. We
                            must push our political leaders to appropriate action under international law.</p>

                        <h3>Current Situation </h3>
                        <p>By now we have all heard about the <a class="dead-link" title="This link is no longer available."
                                title="Background Information from the Save Darfur Campaign">atrocities and genocide</a>
                            occurring in the Darfur region of Sudan. I first heard of them in the editorials of Nicolas
                            Kristof of <em>The New York Times</em> back in March, shortly after they began. While there
                            have been a few references in this news source (<a class="dead-link inn"
                                title="InterfaithNews.Net coverage of remarks from Kofi Annan">1</a>, <a
                                class="dead-link inn" title="InterfaithNews.Net Editorial">2</a>),not enough attention
                            has been paid to this issue that should be paramount for religionists the world over.</p>
                        <p>For the past few months the world has argued about how to respond, how to<strong> prevent
                                over a million refugees from becoming another million deaths from genocide in
                                Africa</strong>. In the meantime atrocities have continued, and the government of Sudan
                            has not kept its promises to halt the harassment. In a scene reminiscent of legal wrangling
                            over the definition of &quot;is&quot; in the mid-90&#39;s, the international community has
                            thus far refused to use the legal term &quot;genocide&quot; to describe the murders, rapes,
                            and displacement of people. As if we need a legal distinction to realize that action is
                            needed! Finally this past week the U.S. Secretary of State, Colin Powell, definitely <a

                                &quot;genocide&quot;</a> to the government backed oppression.</p>
                        <p>Does this mean that action under the international <a

                            for once help deliver military assistance to African victims of genocide. According to a <a

                        <p>At last we have positive movement towards ameliorating the violence. But what about the
                            continuing humanitarian crisis &#8212; the need for food, water, shelter, and the return of
                            refugees? <strong>This is where the international community must work diligently to

                        <h3>Relief Efforts </h3>
                        <p>International donors and the U.N. have been at work since the beginning of refugee movements
                            last winter, and a donor&#39;s conference for fundraising is planned for late in September
                            in Oslo, Norway. Many religious and interfaith organizations have joined (or lead) the
                            efforts, though some are worried that the recent focus on Darfur will hurt similar efforts
                            in the newly peaceful southern regions. The <a href="http://www.uri.org/abouturi/charter/"

                            need is clear and present in all major religions, so I will not belabor that point. As

                            of a unity statement regarding the need to respond to the events in Darfur. They are working
                            to spread the word through congregations and campuses in particular, and are trying to
                            organize a &quot;green ribbon campaign&quot; for grassroots spread of their message. </p>
                        <p>I do not know how effective they have been to date (I found them only after actively
                            searching for Darfur relief efforts), but their intentions, aims, and actions seem to be of
                            utmost purity and profoundly meaningful. <strong>InterfaithNews.Net will join the Save
                                Darfur Coalition green ribbon campaign, and we&#39;d like to use our &quot;pulpit&quot;
                                to urge other religious and interfaith groups to do so as well. </strong></p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
