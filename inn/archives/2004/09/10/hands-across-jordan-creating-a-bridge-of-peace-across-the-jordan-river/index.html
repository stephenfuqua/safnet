                            Can a group of passionate activists from a small town in California
                            really do anything about the retributions, recriminations, and violence in
                            the Middle East? An initiative called &#8220;Hands Across the Jordan&#8221; seeks to
                            find out. Their intention is to build a bridge of peace across the Jordan
                            River, with help from all around the world, to help unite the people of
                            Israel and Jordan in a grassroots effort. Here is their statement.

                        <p> We are a grassroots organization located in the small town of Linda, CA
                            population 13,474. We are making an effort to promote peace in the Middle
                            East. From this little town, things can be done. Please help us by
                            spreading the word.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our initiative is named &ldquo;Hands Across the Jordan.&rdquo; Our
                            intentions are to be politically neutral, and pray for peace in the
                            region. What we wish to do and what we actually do may be two different
                            things, but pray for peace, we will. Our primary objective is to get a
                            large body of people together to show the world&rsquo;s yearning for
                            peace. This is and will be a worldwide effort.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We will build a PEACE BRIDGE across the Jordan River between the Arab
                            world and the Israeli world, in an undisputed area of land. We have
                            personally surveyed and know of an area that meets this criterion. After
                            the bridge is built, we will gather in a circle across the bridge, join
                            hands and pray silently. As you know from your experience in Middle East,
                            we will need both governments of Israel and Jordan to allow this action.
                            This will be non-exclusionary. All people are invited and it will be
                            highly publicized. We have contacts with 1.6 million people throughout
                            the world via peace groups, environmental groups and religious
                            organizations. We are in touch with Jordanians, Palestinians, and
                            Israelis wishing for peaceful solutions to their ordeal.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It would be an honor to join hands with you on the bridge, as respected
                            and accomplished representative of world peace. The International Day of
                            Tolerance is November 16, 2004; this will be the day of the event.

                        <p>
                            Ask yourself, what is peace? How many types of peace are there? What
                            makes up peace? What would you call it, if the only peace I receive were
                            the understanding that you are as pitiful as I am? Peace, as most know
                            it, is a state of mind. Peace of the body, is mental peace. Peace of the
                            spirit is a God given peace. As we think about these questions and
                            statements, we come upon our ability to think freely. Isn&rsquo;t this
                            action yet another type of peace? Not one is more important than the
                            other is. We have mental peace, emotional peace, and environmental peace.
                            Worldwide peace is the combined state of minds across the earth. Each of
                            these can be broken down into categories.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Mental peace is both emotional and environmental peace. The need of the
                            body defines and uses all peace, in a true sense. Appropriately, to
                            determine mental peace, we must think of states of mind and mental
                            activity. Placing duress on any of the types, effects your mind, such is
                            terrorism.
                        </p>
                        <p> Soothsayers in the past called these stimuli. Likes and dislikes are
                            adjusted in ones growth and play important roles in adjusting to
                            environment and culture. If you place someone in an environment that is
                            not of his liking, then what type of peace can he achieve? Isn&rsquo;t
                            peace then a mental state of mind? If I can teach you want and dislike,
                            can&rsquo;t I teach you to be mentally/culturally ill or well? It can be
                            looked at as a mental illness if you haven&rsquo;t the ability to achieve
                            some state of peace.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Capacity of one&rsquo;s use of his intelligence also seems to be
                            important because of one&rsquo;s ability to think. Should a person be
                            very simple, then only simplistic things would give him the mental
                            ambiance of peace. Now if a person has a complex intelligence,
                            shouldn&rsquo;t you think that what is baffling to the simple mind is
                            only mental exercise of resolve for the complex thinker. Difficult
                            problems may offer this person a freedom of thought that will place him
                            in bliss. Since peace has been determined as a state of mind. Mental
                            environment is noted different than physical environment although the
                            physical effects the mental. Now we are coming to the real definition of
                            peace. Peace is a virtue, that God is willing to give; even if He has to
                            judge you and give you a piece of eternity that you deserve. Many people
                            call themselves atheists. This is a choice and another God given virtue.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What ever you equate with effects your peace. Terrorism of any form,
                            effects you emotionally and physically which takes away God&rsquo;s given
                            gift, of grace, known as peace. Those that violate this should live
                            outside God&rsquo;s grace because man&rsquo;s enviable future has been
                            written, as well as the book of life. Blessed is he that knows. If you
                            truly search for Him, you will find Him. He that is true to Him will join
                            Him. May His Holy Spirit touch and be with you. A global community of
                            peace is a culture that God would like. When man learns to live with man
                            then he has a chance to live with God.

                            The InterfaithNews.Net service ran from 2002 through 2006, hosting articles on the

                            version
                            of the site has been restored in 2021 through careful extracts from the <a

                            reformating for consistency. No editorial changes have been made &mdash; all of

                            recovered

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
