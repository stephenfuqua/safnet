                        </p>
                        <p> The task assigned to Bishop Krister Stendahl, former Dean of the Harvard
                            Divinity School, Rabbi Marc Gopin, Laue Professor of World Religions,
                            Diplomacy and Conflict Resolution at George Mason University and
                            Abdulaziz Sachedina, Ball Professor of Religious Studies at the
                            University of Virginia, was to plumb the doctrinal, historical, and
                            psychological depths of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam to discover
                            sources used to justify religious violence and develop approaches to
                            counteract them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In an intellectual, moral, and personal relationship that became
                            increasingly close as their days in residence together progressed,
                            Stendahl, Gopin, and Sachedina concentrated on finding ways to appeal to
                            practicing Christians, Jews, and Muslims by reaffirming traditional
                            religious identities and interpreting the holy writings of each tradition
                            in ways that encourage caring relationships with all human beings. The
                            fellows purposely avoided the interfaith dialogue tradition of appealing
                            to universal values. Instead, they focused on the religious authenticity
                            of their respective work as a Christian, a Jew, and a Muslim through
                            statements directed to their own communities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the following joint statement, each fellow offers the beginning of a
                            work in progress aimed at removing any religious legitimacy for political
                            murder. As the Joint Statement makes clear, the commitment of Stendahl,
                            Gopin, and Sachedina to serve an urgent mission is firm, and they intend
                            to continue their collaboration with each other and with the College of
                            Preachers.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Joint Statement: </h3>
                        <p>
                            Violence in the name of God and religion calls for passionate and
                            reasoned refutations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our three Abrahamic traditions have their share in that sacrilege, both
                            in history and in the present. In our respective languages, speaking from
                            within our communities, we recognize that we are different as Jew,
                            Christian, Muslim, and we treasure our differences as a richness. We
                            recognize even more strongly our common call to honor and preserve the
                            dignity and sanctity of human life.
                        </p>
                        <h3>
                            From Krister Stendahl:
                        </h3>
                        <p> There is a crisis in the Abrahamic family. Religious zeal is increasingly
                            spinning out in hatred and acts of violence. Decades of interfaith
                            dialogues and statements seem ineffective. People die.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For me as a Christian, it is now important to recognize that urgent
                            action is called for. As a Biblical scholar, I know well the texts of
                            Scripture that work for peace, as well as all those words that have aided
                            and abetted Christian teachings of contempt for Jews and Muslims.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But the present urgency brings to mind my great teacher St. Paul. In
                            Corinth, he found conflicts among the faithful and faith-filled. Their
                            different theologies and practices seemed to ruin the community, and so
                            he wrote - or recited - an ode to love. It ends with the words, &#8220;so
                            faith, hope, love abide, but the greatest of them is love.&#8221; Imagine,
                            Paul, the apostle of faith, lets faith be trumped by love!
                        </p>
                        <p> To privilege ethics over theology - that takes a good theologian and a
                            keen awareness of urgency. That is where we are now in our diversity, in
                            our common humanity, in our Abrahamic family, where we share so much in
                            various ways, ways that should enrich us rather than separate us.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In my Bible it says: &#8220;Anyone who says I love God and hates his brother is
                            a liar.&#8221;
                        </p>
                        <h3>
                            From Marc Gopin:
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Ancient Jewish history is replete with moments of emergency, times when
                            prophets and rabbis had to make fateful decisions in order to preserve
                            the possibility of a better future. In so doing, these courageous leaders
                            had to calculate the complex priorities of sacred traditions of Torah,
                            they had to decide on <i>halakhic</i>, Jewish legal/spiritual, priorities to be
                            considered in facing emergencies. Always those priorities favored <i>pikuah
                                nefesh</i>, saving lives, preventing the unnecessary loss of life, and
                            working with tradition in a way that maximized <i>kiddush ha-shem</i>, the
                            sanctification of God&#39;s name on this earth by the Jewish people whose
                            primary task is to live up to, as best as they can, the idea of being an
                            or la-goyim, a light unto the nations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are many challenges facing the global community of nations today in
                            terms of its survival, in terms of discovering a way to live in balance
                            with the earth&#39;s resources, for example. But all of those challenges
                            cannot be successfully confronted by other <i>halakhic</i> priorities such as
                            <i>ba&#39;al tashchit</i>, minimizing waste and destruction of God-given resources
                            and sentient life, if we end up in a war of civilizations within the
                            family of Abraham, as it is represented by Judaism, Christianity and
                            Islam.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We know the challenges. We know that these three children must come to a
                            place of absolute respect, equality, and a recognition of friendly
                            boundaries between loving neighbors. We know that there are
                            <i>halakhic</i> and spiritual resources within Jewish tradition, such as
                            the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>redifat shalom</i>, pursuit of peace, <i>pesharah</i>, the art
                            of compromise, <i>hakem takim imo</i>, helping others in distress&#8211;even
                            enemies, <i>teshuvah</i>, acknowledgement of harm done and commitments to
                            a better future. Above all, however, there is the <i>mitsvah</i> to save human
                            life. Even at a level of pure self-concern, the Jewish people must face
                            the reality of needing coexistence in peace and justice, rather than in
                            terminal violence with billions of Christians and Muslims.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This requires <i>halakhically</i> and ethically unprecedented efforts to reach
                            out to others, to learn from everyone&#39;s wisdom and to share our own on
                            how to coexist with other religions without war, and even with deep
                            respect. Abraham, Sarah, Hagar, Isaac, and Ishmael, would want no less
                            from us. They all wanted children to survive and thrive on this God-given
                            earth, and we owe them our best efforts theologically, <i></i>halakhically</i>, and
                            ethically, at this critical hour of human history.
                        </p>
                        <h3>
                            From Abdulaziz Sachedina:
                        </h3>
                        The world community is looking at the Muslim community and its
                        religious leaders to provide Koranic guidelines that speak to the urgent
                        need to stop meaningless violence in the name of Islam. Both Muslim and
                        non-Muslim lives have been threatened and destroyed in the crossfire of
                        sectarian and religiously justified nationalist movements.</p>
                        <p> There is no shortage of Koranic passages that teach tolerance and respect
                            of other religions. As I read the Koran, it becomes obvious to me that
                            Muslims are required to engage in instituting the good and advancing
                            justice for all humans, as humans. God has honored all the children of
                            Adam and Eve with nobility and has endowed them with the ability to make
                            this earth a stage for just relationships (K: 17:70). This honor, as the
                            Koran teaches, has been extended with special blessing to Abraham, who
                            has been promised leadership among his children who will commit to uphold
                            justice. Hence, Jews, Christians and Muslims are called upon to bear
                            witness to God&#39;s mercy and establish justice and peace among all nations
                            of the world as part of their moral-spiritual commitment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Today this message is in danger because political ambitions of some
                            militant groups have led them to abandon the message of just
                            relationships taught by the Prophet&#39;s tradition (<i>Sunna</i>) and the
                            Koran. The endless violence committed against any human being, whether
                            Muslim or non-Muslim, makes it urgent for the Children of Abraham - that
                            is, Jews, Christians, and Muslims - to engage in creating partnerships in
                            &#8220;competing to do the good&#8221; (K. 5:48) and spreading the ethics of just
                            relationships.

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
