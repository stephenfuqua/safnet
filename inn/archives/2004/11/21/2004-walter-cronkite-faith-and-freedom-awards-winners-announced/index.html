                        <p>Washington, Oct. 13 &mdash; The Interfaith Alliance Foundation and Walter

                        <p>Walter Cronkite and Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy, President of The Interfaith
                            Alliance and The Interfaith Alliance Foundation, will present the award at 7

                        <p>The 2004 selection committee was The Honorable Gerald R. Ford, Honorary
                            Chair; Rev. Dr. Joan Brown Campbell; The Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy; The
                            Honorable John Lewis; Professor Elie Wiesel and Ambassador Andrew Young.</p>
                        <h3>Rev. Dr. James A. Forbes, Jr.</h3>
                        <p>Recognized in 1996 by NEWSWEEK magazine as one of the 12 &quot;most
                            effective preachers&quot; in the English-speaking world, and designated as
                            one of &quot;America&#39;s greatest Black preachers&quot; by Ebony magazine
                            in 1984 and 1993, The Rev. Dr. James Alexander Forbes Jr. is the first
                            African-American and fifth Senior Minister of The Riverside Church in New
                            York City. Recently Dr. Forbes was featured in the New York Times for his
                            work to provide an alternative vision about religion in the 2004 election to
                            the one offered by religious conservatives.</p>
                        <h3>Judith Davidson Moyers</h3>
                        <p>Judith Davidson Moyers serves as president of Public Affairs Television,
                            Inc, an independent production company. Davidson Moyers is an insightful and
                            visionary producer supporting a common civic dream with her professional
                            partner Bill Moyers. Her commitment to creating thoughtful, provocative and
                            inspiring television programs is drawn from her priority for public discourse
                            that challenges, inspires and educates the public on their civic
                            responsibilities.</p>
                        <h3>Bill Moyers</h3>
                        <p>The National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences declared Bill Moyers
                            to be among the ten most influential journalists in television news. As one
                            of the most recognized and respected journalists in America, Moyers uses his
                            powerful voice of faith and reason from the platforms of television, books
                            and speeches for incisive commentary, probing documentaries, and considered
                            reflections on ethics and morality in American life. He retires this year
                            from the long-standing PBS program, &quot;NOW with Bill Moyers,&quot; as the
                            most recent public example of his legacy of unwavering courage in the waves
                            of social and political challenge and change in America.</p>
                        <h3>Walter Cronkite</h3>
                        <p>Walter Cronkite is the former CBS Evening News anchorman whose commentary
                            defined America for almost two decades. His credo was to get the story,
                            &quot;fast, accurate, and unbiased&quot;; his trademark exit line was,
                            &quot;And that&#39;s the way it is.&quot; Americans continue to hold him in
                            such high esteem (he has been repeatedly named &quot;the most trusted man in
                            America&quot;) that his long-awaited autobiography, A Reporter&#39;s Life,
                            debuted at number one on the bestseller list in 1996.</p>
                        <p>Walter Cronkite joined with The Interfaith Alliance Foundation to endorse
                            its efforts to, in his words, &quot;combat the excesses of the so-called
                            Religious Right, a group that organized nationally to push a political agenda
                            in the name of religious faith.&quot; In 1998 the Walter Cronkite Faith &amp;
                            Freedom Award was established to honor individuals who embody the values of
                            civility, tolerance, diversity, and cooperation in the advancement of public
                            dialogue and public policy on traditionally controversial and divisive
                            issues.</p>
                        <p>Previous recipients have included Walter Cronkite; GLBT activist Donna Red
                            Wing; ABC News anchor, Peter Jennings; U.S. Representative Chet Edwards;
                            Oklahoma Observer editor &quot;Frosty&quot; Troy; NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw;

                            Muslim Association; U.S. Representative Amo Houghton; Rabbi Steven Jacobs,
                            leader in interfaith dialogue, racial justice and labor rights; Ms. Kusum
                            Patel, founder of the Gayatri Parivar Yug Nirman Hindu spiritual center; Rev.
                            Dr. James C. Miller, Executive Minister of the Rhode Island State Council of
                            Churches; and Rev. Chris Doss, Director of the Center for the Study of Law
                            and Church at Samford University.</p>
                        <p>Several hundred supporters and friends of The Interfaith Alliance at the
                            gathering will also honor the founders of The Interfaith Alliance as the
                            organization celebrates its tenth anniversary.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable
                    civilization, a global interfaith movement has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
