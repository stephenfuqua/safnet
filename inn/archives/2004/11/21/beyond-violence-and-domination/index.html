                            and spiritual world of ideas. Such a vitalization will lead to a kind of

                            reactions?</h3>
                        <p>Violence will neither be overcome by condemnation of violent acts nor by
                            fighting against them - however cruel and disgusting they might be. Violence
                            is not a solution. Violence causes counter-violence.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>The more bluntly violence crosses our paths,</p>
                            <p> The more violence is being forced on us without alternative,<br />
                                The stronger demanded are the lovers of peace,<br />
                                To stimulate non-violent solutions.</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Only by understanding and revealing the respective motivations, by
                            answering <i>why?</i> and for <i>what?</i> we will create our own chance to
                            overcome violence, be it originated from states, groups or individuals.</p>
                        <p>I do not at all agree with the blaming of Islam. Such a vision is too
                            simple and therefore false. I agree with all of you who are aware of the dead
                            end road of pointing the finger at others for &#39;their being violent&#39;.
                            Following considerations should or could invite more people of different
                            cultural or religious background to look for roots of violence within their
                            respective domains. As we only start to question such subjects we already
                            have identified to be dubious, it is imperative to look for and to identify
                            such roots. As long as we do not start to investigate the complex and
                            interlacing web which nourishes violent action, we will not have any chance
                            for peace. On the contrary, our growing destructive potential threatens
                            global survival. Till today, human race has used its abilities to a major
                            extent only to reconstruct the bludgeon of biblical Cain into a machine of
                            industry, which with its &quot;excretions and radiations being hostile to
                            life&quot; jeopardizes <i>the genetic as well as the cultural roots of health
                                and life.</i></p>
                        <p><i>We have to blame ourselves who tolerate violence as a means of human
                                action - be it in our families, communities or nations.</i></p>
                        <p>Readiness to accept violence as a tool to reach certain goals or as a
                            structure to built societies upon is rooted deep down in the human mind. Some
                            people try to justify violence biologically when they speak about the
                            survival of the fittest. By doing so they think too short as evolution since
                            long proves that the fittest is by no means the strongest, but the organism
                            which cooperates best is.</p>
                        <p><i>Overall cooperation to make real justice come true is the lesson we
                                have to learn on a global scale if humanity&#39;s goal is its&sbquo;
                                survival.</i></p>
                        <p>We, the people of the world suffer from structural injustice, from built
                            in failures of our social systems. Elitist, hegemonic and supremacist
                            tendencies enforce by nature the longing for human dignity and justice. The
                            longing for dignity and justice, however, often openly conflicts with the
                            interests of those in power.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>The spiral of violence is spinning further.</p>
                            <p> Children as hostages represent an intolerable acceleration.<br />
                                To actually sacrifice them<br />
                                Increases delusion immeasurably.</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p><i>From tutelage to state terrorism.</i></p>
                        <p>We suffer from a global terrorist war, which is being legitimatized by so
                            called democracies although a majority of citizens oppose war and terror.</p>
                        <p>Greed for oil, resources and military supremacy are the fuel of war, and
                            local violent and terrorist acts often are mere reactions to the underlying
                            terrorist war for global dominance in the name of a God, who is to bless
                            solely America (<a href="#1">1</a>). Such an elitist notion triggers
                            ignorance of the right to exist for others and for different ways of Life. To
                            the respective audiences such messages create false and completely misleading
                            identifications - identifications which are furthermore abused by the
                            administration making people ready for sacrifices in favour of their
                            identification - voil&agrave;! - again we discover a source of violence! Such
                            messages and similar ones are widely spread and represent nothing but
                            strategically utilized manipulation.</p>
                        <p><i>Ordinary people are being sacrificed, they are the victims.</i></p>
                        <p>That is why we, the ordinary people of the world, regardless of religion,
                            belief, ideology or colour join against the strategists of Death in order to
                            support the creational forces on this planet.</p>
                        <p>Crusades, slavery, Inquisition are all part of human history, or to be
                            more correct, part of Christian history, part of the history of
                            monotheism.</p>
                        <p>At the same time however, in a profound context they are part of the
                            strategy of dominance - still in the name of the good against evil, of God
                            against those who believe differently.</p>
                        <p>So, if we want to overcome dominance and develop a global society in
                            solidarity, we have to confront ourselves also with the mental pitfalls of
                            human psyche on its path towards maturity and freedom from violence.</p>
                        <h3>Responsibility for life increases quality of life</h3>
                        <p>The young and still unconsciously acting psyche defends the standard by
                            which it has been shaped and tends to reproduce the quality of life which it
                            experienced. It tries to carry on the <i>experienced normality</i> into the
                            future.</p>
                        <p>This is, on the one hand, why we tend to react with resistances against
                            alterations or modifications. Within a larger frame this is the reason for
                            resistance of social bodies like those of nation states against alterations -
                            independent from being demanded by the populations, or from being required by
                            the necessities of circumstances. On the other hand, by this quality of the
                            still immature psyche the paradox of the child which was brought up under
                            violent conditions, and has been <i>violated,</i> becomes clear. It becomes
                            understandable, that this child later on when being an adult despite all
                            suffering tends to tolerate and even utilize violence - a vicious circle
                            which is to be overcome.</p>
                        <p>It is the tragedy of the maturing-process of the psyche, that it is ready
                            to defend a standard, the quality of which it has not yet learned to
                            question. The pending step of maturing towards consciously accepting and
                            adopting responsibility represents the decisive step towards human
                            autonomy.</p>
                        <p>If religious or social structures defend themselves against promoting
                            individual autonomy as this would contradict their own fundamentalistic
                            striving for supremacy, they put themselves in the wrong position.
                            Administrations lose any legitimacy when they try to interrupt <i>by law and
                                violent actions</i> emancipation and naturally growing self-responsibility.
                            The natural urge for emancipation (<a href="#2">2</a>) produces a field of
                            tension, the balance of which is being legitimized beyond human made law.</p>
                        <p><i>Responsibility belongs to us by birth.</i></p>
                        <p>Responsibility is being completely ignored by fundamentalism of all
                            origins. Fundamentalism thwarts the chances to mature towards human autonomy
                            when it moves to the domination by a God and his governors. Unfortunately no
                            government feels responsible for the destruction of Creation which is caused
                            in the run of history. That is why we all - regardless of being Muslims,
                            Christians or of any other religion or conviction - have to speak up against
                            the fundamentalism and dogmatism of those reigning structures which do not
                            support further emancipation.</p>
                        <p>Let us try not to fall victim of the <em>divide et impera!</em> (lat.:
                            bring them up against each other and dominate!) of the strategists of Death
                            and Dominance (<a href="#3">3</a>) - let us accept responsibility and prove
                            social competency in joint and public action against further domination of
                            life.</p>
                        <p>Let us communicate even in case our opinions differ - being aware that we
                            would be blocking a further leading and saving flow of information when
                            stopping communication.</p>
                        <p>We have to admit that free flow of information is the prerequisite for
                            human mind to develop and to attune karmically to this overall existence
                            which, expressed in terms of human perception and experience, is sequential
                            and dynamic in the sense of ever becoming better than before and ever more
                            diverse.</p>
                        <p><i>Only free flow of information will lead to the truth of
                                understanding.</i></p>
                        <p>And part of this truth is, that injustice and terrorism have their
                            malicious reasons, they do not fall from the sky.</p>
                        <p>NOBODY is evil by birth. That proves the fact that evil has a social
                            origin.</p>
                        <p>So lets courageously face the fact that we all are being responsible for
                            all what happens, no excuse.</p>
                        <p>Either we jointly overcome injustice, hatred and violence or we will never
                            get peace.</p>
                        <p>Let us clear the fogs of our anger and frustration originating from
                            certain acts of despair, hatred or greed to give us the chance to re-open our
                            clear view for life supporting essentials.</p>
                        <p>Do we as human beings by nature feel sympathy for all the sad things which
                            happen all around the globe?</p>
                        <p>Do we really think human beings are not aware about the different
                            motivations for terrorism?</p>
                        <p>Do we really think human beings are not willing to unveil all the public
                            excuses for manslaughter, be it the victims of traffic, of war, of
                            industrialized and mentally as well as actually poisoned life?</p>
                        <p>We do have to argue if we want to find out about the true and deep reasons
                            for violent actions from all sides which are hidden behind mainstream
                            thinking and awareness.</p>
                        <p>From pornography to arms-industry via mass-media and churches - the open
                            disregard of the polluter pays principle, and the widely spread manipulating
                            use of information prove the already mentioned structural irresponsibility of
                            a society which abuses and consumes itself.</p>
                        <p><i>Nobody of good will can deny that the current world order and economic
                                system rule the world with repressing and marginalizing strategies that
                                dominate the social order of world societies and create a <b>&quot;Culture of
                                    Hatred&quot;</b></i> (Hobsbawm).</p>
                        <p>Its is not the needs of living people which shape global politics but the
                            wishes of lifeless capital which recently turned to direct military action
                            instead of democratic decisions in finding solutions. Just have a close look
                            at the proposal of European constitution with its constitutional obligation
                            for yearly increase of national spending on the military. War against Terror
                            is nothing but a false excuse to solve the crisis of global capital by
                            military violence. War against Terror marks the end of the experiment to
                            react politically to the growing global social problems.</p>
                        <p>Iraq is a proof - Chechnya is a proof - Palestine is a proof. The Proof is
                            the Current Economic World Order</p>
                        <p><i>We are experiencing a fallback to barbarity.</i></p>
                        <p>Again I say let&#39;s not fall victim to alienation which makes it easy
                            for subjugation. Lets us jointly share our perceptions and visions in
                            patience without pointing at others while neglecting profound reasons within
                            ourselves.</p>
                        <p>We are to understand this mechanism of violence, alienation and
                            subjugation and to confront this vicious circle and the people who run it
                            with the true power of universe: our LOVE.</p>
                        <p>Speaking of Love - let us have a closer look at our religions which often
                            only allegedly stand against barbarity. Allegedly - because everyday reality
                            teaches the truth of a different effect.</p>
                        <p><i>Why is that so?</i></p>
                        <p>I am a Christian by education. Still Life taught me more than that. I
                            learned from Islam that there only can be ONE law (not a political one AND
                            another religious one) and I learned that each religion has its treasure. But
                            - <i>&quot;not yet really having come to terms with our history, we are
                                suffering from the effects of unclear religious ideas and future
                                perspectives. This applies to the Christian, the Jewish and the Islamic
                                world, as well as the Eastern world - we are all suffering from our
                                non-compliance with the requirements of nature due to fanatical schisms and
                                self-righteous overestimation. We are suffering from a lack of trust in the
                                power of pluralistic dialogue. We are suffering from the negative effects of
                                suppressed human history. We are mutually suffering under one another
                                because, in spite of all religions, we lack a common orientation that would
                                be conducive to peace.&quot; (</i><a href="#4"><i>4</i></a><i>)</i></p>
                        <p>Certain notions which are being accepted by the <i>monotheistic</i> way of
                            thinking and world view are triggering switches in the brain, consequently
                            making violence acceptable, tolerated and made use of. Those switches however
                            have their origin in human nature not in monotheism, although especially
                            monotheism dangerously tampers with those switches.</p>
                        <p><i>What am I heading at?</i></p>
                        <p>The elitist notion and traditional conception of being something special,
                            of being unique, of preferring the (easy, strong, clean) mono-polar / un-pair
                            (impair = not a pair) and uniform equal as being found also in monotheism -
                            separates all the naturally unequal and diverse, and thus perpetuates a
                            splitting into good and evil. Within this defective and incomplete conception
                            of the world all the following is nothing but a separated and consequently
                            alienated copy of the preceding. Consequently the &#39;new or the
                            different&#39; is dealt with suspicion and fear and will be fought against.
                            Fundamentalism, fanaticism and fascism dwell on suspicion and fear.</p>
                        <p>Further reaching and integrating the balance of diversity of Life seems to
                            be the following conception, which is offered by Javier Lajo, Peru (<a href="<br />
  #5">5</a>): <i>&quot;Conception of the world of binary equalities, of in
                                principle two different elements (Yin and Yang, Yana and Yanan e.g.), the
                                characteristics of which are reciprocal proportionality and mutual
                                complementarity.&quot;</i></p>
                        <p>Resulting concretely: if I only oppose <i>&#39;the evil&#39;</i> without
                            doing enough good, I promote <i>&#39;the evil&#39;</i> even against my
                            intention. The more I do the <i>&#39;good&#39;</i> , the less space will
                            remain for the <i>&#39;evil&#39;</i>.</p>
                        <p>So let us keep on talking with one another tolerantly. May be <i>Evil</i></p>
                        <p> loves it when we argue, but <i>Evil</i> will win if people or nation states
                            do not talk and do not share their identical feelings of fear and joy.</p>
                        <p><i>It is the feeling of joy and peace which leads better than any
                                arguments. Emotionally truthful communication finally leads to this
                                satisfying feeling and existence if we provide the chance.</i></p>
                        <p>War and terror only can be urged out of our social reality by means and
                            effects of justice, compensation, solidarity, never by war and terror.</p>
                        <h3>Violence only can be pacified by its counter-part, finally by Love.</h3>
                        <p>Long since Physics has apprehended a world view, passing beyond the theory
                            of relativity and quantum mechanics with its super-strings and their
                            resonance patterns which always occur in pairs - as well as, both/and -,
                            which is identical to the age-old conception of the dynamically contrasting
                            counter parts which behave in reciprocal proportionality and at the same time
                            also supplement complementarily to the whole.</p>
                        <p><i>Still we miss the transformation of such an understanding into the
                                global social reality. Here we miss veracity and authenticity.</i></p>
                        <p>Why did we not yet reach this decisive goal? Why did we not learn better
                            from history? One important reason for the missing, setting the course
                            towards the global good, is because neither the present is being experienced
                            and perceived as it actually is, nor is history. This is being caused by
                            manipulated information for dubious reasons. Journalists, politicians, clergy
                            and opinion leaders bear the burden <i>of a very special responsibility</i>
                            because the consequences of shaping deficient or even false dominating
                            mainstream perceptions are nothing but devastating on the long run - although
                            they may be profitable and of advantage at first glance.</p>
                        <p>This is why we urgently need a public dialogue based on a partnership of
                            all people who care for the common good. <i>The hidden effects related to the
                                quality of traditional conceptions, values and standards have to be
                                questioned, discussed and disclosed for the sake of global survival.</i></p>
                        <p>Mediating and meditative meetings expose the overwhelming spirit of love
                            beyond any dogma and vitalize the intellectual as well as the spiritual world
                            of ideas. Apart from being mentally fully awake, our hearts will be re-opened
                            to feel and understand.</p>
                        <p>People widely re-learn to trust their hearts as the sensitive organ which
                            it is, apart from being the pump of our circulating and life maintaining
                            blood flow. The human heart is an organ which is able to distinct between
                            life saving and life threatening if we are trained and allowed to listen to
                            its decisions.</p>
                        <p>Sensing words, feelings or situations which are coherent with overall
                            life&#39;s needs, will cause a warm heart full of inner joy and satisfaction,
                            whereas, when detecting radiation or vibration with information which is
                            harmful and threatening to overall life&#39;s needs we know how that feels.
                            Fearful and tightly squeezing the chest to such an extent, even often not
                            being consciously felt, we stop or at least reduce breathing and by doing so
                            get even more fearful and timid, freezing physically and mentally. Such a way
                            many people are being kept where they (mentally) are, (imperfect) social
                            systems are being perpetuated, fear helps the status quo to continue no
                            matter what kind of quality concerning life&#39;s needs it presents.</p>
                        <p>Let us train human hearts to courageously detect the quality of vibration
                            which they are confronted with in different situations. Let us use and
                            develop our mental abilities and at the same time always listen to the
                            message of our heart.</p>
                        <p>Such a way we will create the human analogue to the natural instinct: <i>A
                                Safely Guiding Global Culture</i></p>

                            of diversity.</h3>
                        <p>The greater our thoughts get determined by profound understanding than by
                            dogma, the safer become our actions, and then less dangerous life.</p>
                        <p>Each of us who at least once transcended one&#39;s own traditionally
                            shaped mental borders and realized the space of pure existence and being with
                            genuine experience is aware about the common roots of Life and its web-like
                            interconnectedness that is based on something overwhelmingly warm, bright,
                            loving and abundantly nourishing. We cannot really describe this finally

                            individual and social malfunctions or diseases - which all take us back
                            toward a way of life that supports the overall global good.</p>
                        <p>Consequently my suggestion for us on our paths trying to overcome the
                            deliberately created or at least tolerated pathological symptoms of VIOLENCE
                            and DOMINATION is double-fold:</p>
                        <p>First of all let us strengthen the qualities of our pulsing heart by
                            listening to its message, by sharing this message and bringing it to the
                            public. Sympathy is a key to sensing the quality of vibrations. Information
                            contains vibration, vibration is information.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, when reading or taking up information - be it religious or any
                            other = when LEARNING - let us not only mobilise our mental capacity but also
                            the (cap)ability of our heart. Such way we can very sensitively learn to
                            distinguish between genuine vibrations on the one hand, which supply us with
                            energy and nourish our life-drive, and alienated information on the other
                            which makes us freeze - empties us emotionally and by doing so creates the
                            secondary drives like greed, addiction etc. It is healthier and of advantage
                            for all to trust our hearts than to suffer from mental prejudice or
                            error.</p>
                        <p>We all consist of the same molecular patterns and we all depend on the
                            same nourishing vibrations. Fully awake and fully aware, living and learning
                            by using brain and heart at the same time, by mentally and emotionally being
                            sensitive, by having all existing needs in mind, we are very well equipped
                            and enforced. We are connected to what I call a &#39;Divine Umbilical
                            Cord&#39;. We are being interconnected to and by our genuine Human Religion
                            in the service of the present and the future. We are ONE, the problem still
                            is, some do not believe, do not know yet.</p>
                        <p>Finally , however, against all resistance we will be mature human beings
                            and make a quality of life come true which in some religions is being
                            described as paradise.</p>
                        <p>People who are touched by similar visions consequently want to serve the
                            common good. Guided by the <i>pressure or duty to emancipate</i> they want to
                            create a global culture which is beyond violence and destructive tensions. A
                            culture of reciprocal dialogue and steady balancing without winners and
                            losers, a culture which meets the life saving standard of natural instinct -
                            a culture which guarantees the social dimension of humanity that is embedded
                            in Nature will provide chances for the future.</p>
                        <p>Epilogue: <i>Isn&#39;t harmony a quality of unity? Does unity really stand
                                against diversity? Isn&#39;t nature the proof for unity in diversity?
                                Isn&#39;t convergence actually motivated by a deeply rooted and still hidden
                                consensus which is waiting to be discovered by human consciousness? Ordinary
                                people, be them believers or not, proceed more courageously towards consensus
                                than their respective religious bodies and institutions. Not to mention the
                                political structures! Administrations fear loss of influence in case of
                                growing independence and autonomy of their respective communities. Isn&#39;t
                                the common goal of peace within the global community compensation enough to
                                heal from that fear? Isn&#39;t justice and peace within the global community
                                of life the highest goal we ever can achieve? Isn&#39;t it exactly that goal
                                what all religious founders originally had in mind?</i></p>

                                emancipate</i> we understand that part of the drive of life, which strives
                            for realisation of a social reality, which preserves the space of life for
                            all and in future finally is about <i>responsibility.</i> It is about
                            utilizing <i>the monopoly of force of the power of Life</i> with
                            responsibility in which the effect defines the quality of action. Here we get
                            into the sensitive area, the space of understanding and perception and of
                            re-action. As long as our sensors are not <i>wrongly adjusted</i> by
                            misjudgement, feelings of joy and sorrow are aiming towards necessary
                            corrections. Therefore we have a mental approach to the problem.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable
                    civilization, a global interfaith movement has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
