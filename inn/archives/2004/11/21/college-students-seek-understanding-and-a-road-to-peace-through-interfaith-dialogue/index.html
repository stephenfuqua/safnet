                        <p>NEW YORK, October 12, 2004 &ndash; As part of the celebration of
                            interfaith awareness during October, Faith &amp; Values Media has partnered
                            with The National Conference for Community and Justice (NCCJ) and the
                            Interfaith Youth Core to launch &quot;CampusQuest,&quot; an interfaith
                            outreach project. <em>CampusQuest</em> is designed to help students promote
                            interfaith dialogue during the 2004-2005 school year, and to make this
                            dialogue a vital and visible part of campus life.</p>
                        <p>The NCCJ is a human relations organization dedicated to fighting bias,
                            bigotry and racism in America. Interfaith Youth Core seeks to build a
                            movement that encourages religious young people to strengthen their religious
                            identities, foster inter-religious understanding and cooperate to serve the
                            common good.</p>
                        <p>The launch of local <em>CampusQuest</em> campaigns will coincide with the
                            national premiere of &quot;The Quest for Peace,&quot; an original television
                            documentary presented by Faith &amp; Values Media, which is airing this month
                            on Hallmark Channel. The partnering organizations will provide screening
                            tapes of &quot;The Quest for Peace&quot; for student groups to preview at an
                            official launch party to kick-off the start of their local
                            <em>CampusQuest</em> projects. In addition, participating campuses will have
                            access to support resources at www.campusquest.org, national publicity, and
                            marketing materials including: brochures, t-shirts, posters, pens, and a
                            trailer of the program on DVD to promote the program on campus. Faith &amp;
                            Values Media will also offer cash grants to student groups, selected by an
                            expert review panel, whose interfaith projects hold the greatest promise for
                            increasing understanding across faith lines.
                        </p>
                        <p>&quot;By developing their own initiatives to explore interfaith and
                            cross-cultural relationships on college campuses, students will have an
                            opportunity to be creative,&quot; said Edward J. Murray, president and chief
                            executive officer of Faith &amp; Values Media. &quot;With the help of
                            &#39;Campus Quest&#39; online support and resources, students can encourage
                            interfaith understanding on their campus and in the broader
                            community.&quot;</p>
                        <p>Students, faculty, and staff from participating colleges can log on to
                            <a class="dead-link" title="This link is no longer available.">www.campusquest.org</a> to
                            find information
                            about creating and implementing an interfaith dialogue project. Through the
                            interactive <em>CampusQuest</em> Website, students, faculty, campus clergy
                            and student advisors can access a variety of resources and are invited to
                            begin developing a &quot;plan of action&quot; for a six-month mission, to
                            culminate in April 2005. Participants will find practical suggestions for
                            developing a strategic plan, examples of successful interfaith activities,
                            and other resources, including: historical background and facts about the
                            three Abrahamic faiths, suggested readings, and practical suggestions from
                            the cast of the television documentary.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Website will also include opportunities for participants to submit
                            comments about their project experience as it unfolds, to report monthly
                            progress, and to correspond with other student teams around the country.</p>
                        <p>The <em>CampusQuest</em> activities are modeled on &quot;The Quest for
                            Peace&quot; television program, which follows three multi-faith,
                            multi-cultural teams of students as they study the sources of interfaith
                            conflict around the world. During their six-week journey through communities
                            in the Middle East, North Africa and the United States, the Jewish, Christian
                            and Muslim students are shown exploring complicated questions about religious
                            tolerance and the prospects for peace. The 12 students from the television
                            program will serve as virtual guides and mentors for participants as they
                            begin their own &quot;quests&quot; on local campuses.</p>
                        <p>&quot;The Quest for Peace&quot; was produced for Faith &amp; Values Media
                            by Pantheon Studios, Inc., and is a key component of Faith &amp; Values
                            Media&#39;s celebration of interfaith awareness during the month of
                            October.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable
                    civilization, a global interfaith movement has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
