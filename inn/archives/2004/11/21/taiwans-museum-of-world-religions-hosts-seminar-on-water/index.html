                        <p>Taiwan&#39;s pioneering Museum of World Religions recently hosted a
                            seminar on the Spiritual and Ecological Signficance of Water. A short report
                            on the seminar and the museum follows.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p class="author">By Taiwan Church News</p>
                    <div class="entry">
                        <p><a href="http://www.mwr.org.tw/">The Museum of World Religions</a> in
                            Taipei hosted a seminar on the Spiritual and Ecological Significance of Water
                            from 6 to 12 November. The Rev. Lim Sin-to, a Presbyterian clergyman, said,
                            &quot;This event calling on religious groups to comment on water resources
                            offers each religion an opportunity to show its own human resource and wisdom
                            capacity. Giving each group an arena to address the issue from its own
                            standpoint shows the concern that people of faith have and gives us an
                            opportunity for interfaith dialogue and exchange.</p>
                        <p>According to Rev. Lim this is the first time in Taiwan&#39;s history that
                            religions have come together as religious groups to hold an interfaith
                            seminar on a focused issue. He did not conceal his enthusiasm for the
                            prospect of having every religion on Taiwan represented at such an event of
                            interchange.</p>
                        <p>According to United Nations&#39; statistics, by the year 2025 three
                            fourths of the world&#39;s landmass will have water resource problems. This
                            brings serious challenges to people of faith. Rev. Lim calls for Christians
                            to face the future based on the Biblical principles of justice and peace.</p>
                        <p>Access to healthy drinking water for people around the world has recently
                            become a critical concern amongst many interreligious groups. At the recent
                            Parliament of the World&#39;s Religions in Barcelona, Spain, the theme of
                            &quot;access to safe water&quot; was one of four issues highlighted
                            throughout the conference. Dharma Master Hsin Tao, founder of the Museum of
                            World Religions, was amongst those committing to promote water quality issues
                            at the Parliament&#39;s conclusion, pledging to &quot;reduce water pollution
                            by promoting care and concerns from the public to the government of Taiwan
                            and create trust and commitments between all religions in Taiwan.&quot;</p>
                        <p>The Museum opened in November of 2001 with exhibits featuring most of the
                            world&#39;s major religions and two rotating displays on ancient and
                            indigenous religions (beginning with Egyptian and Mayan beliefs). Master Hsin
                            Tao, originally of Burmese origin, says that &quot;[t]he Museum of World
                            Religions belongs to all faiths. Its founding is inspiring and encouraging
                            interfaith dialogue so that we all work together to create peace and
                            understanding in the world we share.&quot;</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable
                    civilization, a global interfaith movement has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
