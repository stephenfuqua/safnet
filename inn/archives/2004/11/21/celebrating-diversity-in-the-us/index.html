                    <p class="author">By Susanna Stefanachi Macomb</p>
                    <p class="postdate">November 21st, 2004 by sfuqua </p>
                    <div class="lead">
                        <p>Interfaith minister Susanna Stefanachi Macomb writes about the growing
                            trend of interfaith, intercultural and interracial families in the United
                            States</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="entry">
                        <p>The great American philosopher Emerson spoke of &quot;unity in
                            diversity&quot;, something that is foundational to the American ideal. To be
                            open to diversity in general is a very good first step. However, it seems to
                            me that unity in diversity is the greater call and aim. This unity requires a
                            certain quality of heart. It requires a love for all God&#39;s creatures,
                            great and small, irrespective and because of their infinite varieties in
                            color, culture, religious belief, gender, sexual preference, philosophy or
                            social and economic status.</p>
                        <p>Now grant you, this is easier said then done. Advances in technology and
                            communications, changes in the way we work, the ability to travel anywhere
                            &mdash; all have created a truly global village. People from all countries
                            are interacting with one another to an ever-increasing extent. Most societies
                            are still intrinsically tribal and segregated. However, our world is getting
                            smaller by the minute. Inevitably, people of different backgrounds are
                            getting to know one another, especially in the world&#39;s great
                            multicultural epicenters, our major urban cities. Invariably, many of these
                            folks of different backgrounds are falling in love, getting married and
                            having children.</p>
                        <p>Statistics show that approximately 1/3 of all new marriages now taking
                            place in the U.S. are intermarriages &mdash; that is interfaith,
                            intercultural or interracial in nature. A 2001 survey by the Graduate Center
                            at the City University of New York shows that 29 million American couples
                            (married or not) live in mixed-religion homes. One survey, according to the
                            NY Times, finds that 40 percent of Americans had dated someone of another
                            race.</p>
                        <p>When it comes to matter of religion and intermarriage in the U.S:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Over forty percent of marriage-age Catholics marry outside the Church,
                                a doubling since the 1960s.</li>
                            <li>Three in ten Mormons are now in interfaith marriages.</li>
                            <li>One in three Episcopalians and one in four Lutherans have married
                                outside their churches.</li>
                            <li>The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America reports that two-thirds of
                                its marriages are interfaith.</li>
                            <li>The number of Jewish-Christian couples doubled to one million during
                                the 1990s.</li>
                            <li>Four in ten Muslims are choosing non-Muslim spouses.</li>
                            <li>The intermarriage rate approaches sixty percent for Buddhists, the
                                fastest-growing Eastern religion in the United States.</li>
                            <li>The only outdated statistic I could find with regard to intermarriage
                                in Hinduism is ten years old and states that 5 percent of Hindus live in
                                interfaith households.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Here are more numbers and facts:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Of the over one million LEGAL immigrants a year entering the US, over
                                80 percent are non-European. The greatest numbers are from Latin America,
                                the Caribbean as well as Asian countries.</li>
                            <li>The U.S. census revealed that, among native born, married, Americans
                                ages 25-34 years old, over two-fifths of Hispanics and one-half of Asians
                                had spouses who belonged to a different ethnic or racial group. The number
                                of black-white couples alone tripled between the years of 1970 and 1991.
                                This is significant when we note that as recent as 1958 a white mother in
                                Monroe, N.C., called the police after her young daughter kissed a black
                                playmate on the cheek. The boy, Hanover Thompson, age 9, was then sentenced
                                to 14 years in prison for attempted rape. Outrageous but true. After failed
                                appeals, he was released following a public outcry. Today we have Clarence
                                Thomas, a conservative black supreme court justice who lives in Virginia,
                                married to a white woman, and ironically it was in Virginia that the case
                                of Loving v. Virginia struck down antimiscegnation laws.</li>
                            <li>40 percent of all children born to an Asian or Pacific Islander parent
                                also have a non- Asian or non-Pacific Islander parent. The number of
                                Japanese-American children being born today who have one non-Japanese
                                parent jumped to 60 percent in recent years. Here we have come a long way
                                from World War II when we placed those of Japanese heritage in internment
                                camps.</li>
                            <li>Today, the world&#39;s most famous child of intermarriage is our
                                beloved Tiger Woods whose ancestry is a combination of black, Thai,
                                Chinese, white and Native American.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These diversity figures are quickly rising giving weight to the words of
                            Martin Luther King, &quot;Hate cannot drive out hate. Only love can do
                            that.&quot;</p>
                        <p>As an interfaith minister, I have had the privilege of working with people
                            from an amazing variety of backgrounds. I have studied the world&#39;s great
                            traditions. Increasingly exposed to their teachings, their followers and
                            rituals, I learn more and more of the transcendence of this glorious
                            universe. After all, the essence of each tradition is alight with the same
                            fire. It is the lamps that are different.</p>
                        <p>I counsel blended families&#8230; especially through life&#39;s major
                            rites of passage. My book, Joining Hands and Hearts deals with the topic of
                            intermarriage. With regards to intermarriage, I have worked with some of the
                            most challenging situations: The joining of an elite upper class Southern
                            debutante with a middle class African American from the north. Her father
                            refused to walk her down the aisle until he and his wife spent some time
                            talking with me. I had spent months counseling a Palestinian Muslim and an
                            American Jew who had fallen in love. Unfortunately, their families did not
                            share in their happiness (to put it mildly) Then as fate would have it, one
                            of them barely survived 9/11. After that they said to me, &quot;We now know
                            what is important in life. Will you marry us?&quot; I have worked with
                            children of Holocaust survivors&#8230; one fell in love with a devout German
                            Catholic and another with a Greek Orthodox woman. I have counseled Indian
                            Hindus marrying Middle-Eastern Muslims. Irish Catholics marrying Moroccan
                            Muslims. Vietnamese Buddhist marrying Sicilian Catholic. Iranian Jewish
                            marrying Chinese Taoist. African American marrying British (both
                            Episcopalian)&#8230; .Japanese Shinto marrying American Jewish. Latin
                            American Born Again Christian marrying Korean Agnostic&#8230; . Pakistani
                            Zoroastrian marrying American Buddhist. I have celebrated many unions where
                            there existed 4-5-6-7 cultures between them. Chante` and Judah, for example,
                            a couple featured within my book had between them a combined African
                            American, Native American, French, Polish, Russian, Catholic, Baptist,
                            Jewish, Sufi, Rasta heritage. 10 traditions, 10 times blessed!</p>
                        <p>Some of these families choose to raise their child in one faith. Others
                            choose to celebrate the full breadth of their cultural and religious
                            heritage. Still others choose a third religion for their blended family,
                            while there are those who prefer a non-denominational neutral approach. There
                            are no cookie cutter solutions here. The answers are as varied as the
                            families themselves.</p>
                        <p>Not too long ago, I performed the memorial service for a wonderful
                            Albanian Muslim woman who died at the ripe age of 92. Her five Albanian
                            Muslim children had married Middle Eastern Muslims and European Christians
                            and her grandchildren extended their circle even further by intermarrying
                            with Jewish, Chinese and Latin spouses. Yes, for the service, we incorporated
                            a blend of all these prayers and traditions.</p>
                        <p>Someone once compared my office studio to an U.N. outpost. And sometimes
                            in certainly feels that way. I consider this work a gift. Personally, I revel
                            in the symphony of mankind&#39;s colors, textures and traditions. However, I
                            won&#39;t lie to you by saying that it&#39;s easy work. One of my favorite
                            stories in this regard was told to me by a Methodist minister from the
                            Mid-West. He was to co-officiate with a Rabbi for an interfaith,
                            intercultural wedding ceremony. They both showed up at a scheduled meeting
                            between the two families. The meeting was so acrimonious that afterwards the
                            Rabbi turned to the minister and said, &quot;You do the ceremony, and
                            I&#39;ll pray for you!&quot;</p>
                        <p>Sometimes I refer to my studio office as the crying room. For I have also
                            counseled many young folks who were disowned by their parents for marrying
                            someone of a different color or faith. I have seen relationships fall apart
                            because of external family tensions due to the intermarriage issue. Having
                            said that, I have seen many more relationships where love has conquered
                            all.</p>
                        <p>Generally, the younger generation is more interfaith and multicultural in
                            terms of their peer group and in their love relationships. Usually it is the
                            parents and grandparents that have the issues. I remember one particular
                            conversation amongst family members at a wedding reception of a
                            multi-cultural union where one young person stated (quite joyously),
                            &quot;Soon we (humanity) all will be mixed in one way or another.&quot; His
                            elderly grandmother immediately took my arm and commented, &quot;I know.
                            Isn&#39;t it just awful!&quot;</p>
                        <p>Some people see this ever increasing diversity as a cause of alarm. They
                            feel that we are losing our way life. Others fear that the present majority
                            will become the minority. Still others simply fear what they don&#39;t know.
                            Fear breeds all the &quot;&ldquo;isms, racism, sexism, religiousism,
                            classism, ageism etc. We need to rise up, examine and face our fears. We all
                            have fears, prejudices and biases. Be wary of those who say they do not!
                            Martin Luther King once admitted that it was not the angels of darkness he
                            feared (for he knew where to find them and where they stood), it was the
                            angels of light.</p>
                        <p>What can we do as individuals? We can speak out when we see any of the
                            isms spreading. We can reach out and learn another&#39;s point of view and
                            way of life. We can participate joyously. And we can practice empathy.
                            Empathy is a powerful tool.</p>
                        <p>As a white person, I may never understand what it means to be a black
                            person with a history of brutal, demoralizing slavery where my people were
                            told by white people that we were less than human &mdash; but I can try. I
                            can study African American history, read books, watch documentaries. I can
                            look at the horrors of what was done and face it head on. I can examine my
                            own guilt and fear. I can look at the racism that still goes on today &mdash;
                            including subtle racism. This takes courage.</p>
                        <p>Raised as a Christian, I may never be able to understand what is means to
                            be a Jew. What does it mean to live knowing that humanity turned their heads
                            and collaborated in a heinous genocide upon my people? But I can try. I can
                            study the history of pogroms, of the holocaust. I can listen to the stories
                            told by Holocaust survivors. And I can look squarely into today&#39;s face of
                            anti-Semitism. I can, at the very least, try.</p>
                        <p>As a non-Asian, I may not be able to completely understand the frustration
                            of all the stereotyping &mdash; the many assumptions that people often make
                            about Asians &mdash; but I can listen and learn. For example, one Chinese
                            high school student told me that he was sick and tired of everyone assuming
                            that he was good at math. He wasn&#39;t. He was more inclined towards the
                            arts. A Korean man told me that he resented how many non-Asian women somehow
                            perceived him as somehow being less sexual than Caucasian, African American
                            or Latin men. Stereotyping &mdash; though we all do it to some degree &mdash;
                            is a form of racism. The key is to be aware &mdash; be alert &mdash; when you
                            are doing it. Then slowly we will be able to stop.</p>
                        <p>As a non-Muslim, I may not be able to fully grasp what it means to be a
                            Muslim living in America today&#8230; but I can try. I have to face looks of
                            fear, distrust or anger&#8211;often sneers and comments from my neighbors who look
                            at me, my family and my relatives and often see nothing but terrorists. The
                            word Islam comes from the word peace. Yet how many of us are willing to take
                            the time or energy to learn about this religion which brings peace to over 1
                            billion of our world neighbors? We MUST try.</p>
                        <p>So much fear is dispelled when we get to know one another through listen
                            and talk. Huston Smith once wrote, &quot;Those who listen, listen for
                            peace.&quot; It takes a quality of heart to want that. It takes love and
                            compassion to revel in the fullness and beauty of humanity&#39;s mosaic. That
                            seems to me to be the great call. Humanity has made tremendous progress. I,
                            for one, rejoice in that progress and I recognize that we still have a long
                            way to go.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable
                    civilization, a global interfaith movement has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
