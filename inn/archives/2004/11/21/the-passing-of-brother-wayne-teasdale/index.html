                        <p>Though I had only briefly met &quot;Brother Wayne,&quot; I was saddened to
                            learn of his passing on October 20, 2004. Brother Wayne was surely amongst
                            the foremost blenders of Christian mysticism and activism within the world.
                            Over the last several years, I had grown to have an inkling of his greatness
                            in chance encounters with his voluminous writings on the future of
                            interreligious cooperation. But not having known him personally, I will leave
                            the proper obituaries to a few links and invite those of you who knew him to
                            create accounts here, login, and leave your comments about Brother
                            Wayne&#39;s life.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable

                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
