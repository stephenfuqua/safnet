                        <p>Dear URI friends,</p>
                        <p>Throughout the year the United Religions Initiative at the United Nations
                            Cooperation Circle has hosted a number of dialogues on the Ethical and
                            Spiritual Dimensions of the Millennium Development Goals. Last month we
                            co-sponsored a successful workshop for the annual conference of
                            Non-Governmental Organizations with the Department of Public Information at
                            UN Headquarters, drawing participants from many countries.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Noel Brown, president of the Friends of the United Nations and former
                            head of the UN Environment Programme for the North America Region, gave a
                            keynote address that was followed by a stimulating discussion loosely based
                            on the Appreciative Inquiry format.</p>
                        <p>Below is a report on the program.</p>
                        <p>The interactive workshop structure can be used as a model to engage your
                            constituency and others in your region in a similar program about the Ethical
                            and Spiritual Dimensions of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We
                            encourage you to facilitate this kind of conversation to stimulate global
                            action for the MDGs. Thoughtful debate about issues pertaining to our global
                            future will help engage people of different faiths in collaborative work for
                            a better world.</p>
                        <p>We welcome your feedback, as well as reports of your activities that
                            pertain to the MDGs or other UN-related issues.</p>

                        <p><b>THE 57TH ANNUAL DPI/NGO CONFERENCE
                                Midday Workshop, 10 September 2004</b></p>
                        <p><b>Report by Deborah Moldow, Facilitator The United Religions Initiative
                                at the United Nations</b></p>
                        <p>The theme of the 2004 DPI/NGO Conference at the United Nations
                            headquarters from 8-10 September was &quot;The Millennium Development Goals:
                            Civil Society Takes Action.&quot; The conference, which boasted 1,800
                            participants from at least 79 countries, was organized by a committee chaired
                            by Sr. Joan Kirby of the Temple of Understanding and member of the council of
                            the United Religions Initiative at the United Nations CC, known as
                            URI-UN.</p>
                        <p>This annual conference is traditionally enlivened by a selection of midday
                            workshops organized by NGO groups to allow more active participation in a
                            variety of topics related to the theme. On Friday, Sept. 10th, the URI-UN and
                            our friends on the newly-formed New York NGO Committee on Spirituality,
                            Values and Global Concerns hosted an interactive workshop entitled &quot;The
                            Ethical and Spiritual Dimensions of the Millennium Development
                            Goals.&quot;</p>
                        <p>The workshop was well attended, with about 75 people filling the small
                            conference room. Deborah Moldow, facilitator of URI-UN, welcomed everyone and
                            requested a Moment of Silence, followed by an invocation prayer led by Audrey
                            Kitagawa, co-facilitator of URI-UN. Monica Willard, URI Representative to the
                            UN, then introduced the Keynote Speaker, Dr. Noel J. Brown, president of
                            Friends of the United Nations and former head of the UN Environment Programme
                            for the North American Region.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Brown delivered a rousing and inspiring address. He characterized the
                            Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as &quot;the moral expression of the
                            hopes of the leaders of the world at the dawn of the new millennium.&quot; He
                            spoke of the &quot;singular erosion of the moral order&quot; in a
                            &quot;climate of terror and a culture of fear.&quot; He warned that&quot; the
                            war against terror has eclipsed the war against poverty,&quot; and asked,
                            &quot;How do we build a global political ethos?&quot; He stated that, despite
                            many setbacks, the UN still has a moral capability that must be engaged.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Brown offered a number of practical suggestions for moving forward,
                            including the following:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Propose a Millennium Development Day, to provide a focus of attention
                                and measure progress across the globe;</li>
                            <li>Produce textbooks and curricula to bring the MDGs into the educational
                                process. Create a children&#39;s version of the MDGs and games in which
                                they can be achieved. An MDG scholarship was also suggested;</li>
                            <li>Prepare a report on the Ethical and Spiritual Dimensions of the
                                Millennium Development Goals and submit it to the Secretary-General.
                                Organize NGO Millennium Development Partners to work with the United
                                Nations.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Dr. Brown&#39;s remarks were warmly received. After one or two questions,
                            it was time to move on to the interactive segment of the workshop.
                            Participants were asked to move into groups, each of which would focus on one
                            of the MDGs. In a process that drew inspiration from Appreciative Inquiry,
                            each group responded to these instructions:</p>
                        <p><b>Question for each group member:</b> (10 minutes)
                            How do the ethical and spiritual dimensions of this MDG empower your
                            NGO&#39;s work? Introduce yourself and your work.</p>
                        <p><b>Group discussion:</b> (10 minutes)
                            Which are the key ethical and spiritual principles that underlie or support
                            this MDG? Principles from religion, ethics, morality, history, etc.</p>
                        <p><b>Group Statement:</b> (10 minutes)
                            What statement would your group make to summarize the ethical and spiritual
                            dimensions of this MDG? One sentence, please.</p>
                        <p>After a half-hour of lively discussion, the groups reported back to the
                            whole gathering. Remarkably, the groups had managed, in the short time, to
                            come up with rather cohesive statements, as follows:</p>
                        <p>GOAL 1: ERADICATE EXTREME POVERTY AND HUNGER &mdash; Barbara Valocore,
                            facilitator Poverty and hunger diminish human dignity. We are one human race,
                            so what affects the poorest affects us all. Do something every day &mdash;
                            take it personally.</p>
                        <p>GOAL 2: ACHIEVE UNIVERSAL PRIMARY EDUCATION &mdash; Nickolai Parker,
                            facilitator It is crucial for children especially to develop images of
                            themselves that inculcate values of friendliness, love, compassion, respect
                            for diversity, generosity, justice, fairness, peace, kindness and acceptance
                            in their lives. As part of this process, we suggest incorporating these
                            values into children&#39;s games and play, and to create children&#39;s
                            versions of the MDGs that include these ethical, moral, and spiritual
                            dimensions to imbue young people with the worth and importance of the
                            development goals.</p>
                        <p>GOAL 3: PROMOTE GENDER EQUALITY AND EMPOWER WOMEN &mdash; Monica Willard,
                            facilitator Our goal is to create a Culture of Peace in which the equality of
                            women and men would redress the imbalance that arose historically with a
                            Culture of Violence that has included trafficking of women and other abuses.
                            The qualities of this Culture of Peace include unity, partnership, balance,
                            communication, compassion, and receptivity, qualities that are valued by
                            women as builders of society.</p>
                        <p>GOAL 4: REDUCE CHILD MORTALITY &mdash; Frances Edwards, facilitator GOAL
                            5: IMPROVE MATERNAL HEALTH &mdash; John Clausen, facilitator (combined
                            report) We value all life on earth and acknowledge that each human life has a
                            unique purpose. We honor women as the sacred chalice that gives birth to the
                            child. As such, her health and well-being are vital and she should be
                            surrounded by beauty.</p>
                        <p>GOAL 6: COMBAT HIV/AIDS, MALARIA AND OTHER DISEASES &mdash; Martha
                            Gallahue, facilitator All spheres of society are affected by the infectious
                            diseases of HIV/AIDS, TB, malaria and emerging &amp; re-emerging diseases
                            (i.e. sand flea parasite and polio). Business and academia have a duty to
                            engage with the international community of government and NGOs in the study,
                            recommendation and deployment of solutions to MDG #6 (with cognizance of the
                            other MDGs). The bond of covenant transcends gender, religion and geography.
                            Infectious disease knows no boundaries, so it is incumbent upon all members
                            of humanity to create and implement compassionate policy.</p>
                        <p>GOAL 7: ENSURE ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY &mdash; Noel Brown,
                            facilitator It is our sacred duty to revere and care for the world to
                            preserve the beauty and abundance of nature that is the birthright of all
                            humanity.</p>
                        <p>GOAL 8: DEVELOP GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP FOR DEVELOPMENT &mdash; Diane Williams,
                            facilitator</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Do unto others as you wish done unto you;</li>
                            <li>Develop a new spiritual consciousness on how to be a responsible global
                                citizen in the world today, and awaken a spiritual (r)evolution driving
                                global partnerships;</li>
                            <li>In an interdependent world, global partnerships serve the material
                                needs of citizens in developing countries and provide an opportunity in the
                                richer countries to share resources to meet the needs of all the people in
                                the world.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>We celebrated with an enthusiastic round of applause.</p>
                        <p>After some encouraging remarks by Dr. Brown, Diane Williams, chair of the
                            New York NGO Committee on Spirituality, Values and Global Concerns, delivered
                            a closing statement, reminding us that the very values that underpinned the
                            work of Mother Teresa, Mahatma Gandhi and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. are the
                            same as those that move us to support the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
                        <p>As we closed with a final Moment of Silence in gratitude, a participant
                            requested that we all join hands &mdash; a sight not often seen in a United
                            Nations conference room. Together, we affirmed a sincere prayer: May Peace
                            Prevail on Earth!</p>
                        <hr />
                        <p>Later on, in the main conference hall, Laurence Singer of the NGO Global
                            Family for Love and Peace, presented a summary of our workshop to the closing
                            session of the conference. His excellent report is below:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h3>PRESENTATION OF THE WORKSHOP ON&quot;THE ETHICAL AND SPIRITUAL
                                DIMENSIONS OF THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS&quot; THE 57TH ANNUAL
                                DPI/NGO CONFERENCE</h3>
                            <p>In order to best implement the MDGs and insure sustainability of the
                                goals, we must explore and include the ethical, moral, and spiritual
                                dimensions of friendliness, love, compassion, respect for diversity,
                                generosity, justice, fairness, peace, kindness and acceptance. The real
                                power of the United Nations is the moral force that distinguishes humans
                                from other living beings. It is the ethical, moral, and spiritual forces,
                                the foundations of the world&#39;s religious and spiritual traditions,
                                which can transform political inertia into the political will necessary to
                                achieve and surpass the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
                            <p>For children especially, it is crucial for them to develop images of
                                themselves that inculcate these ethical, moral, and spiritual values in
                                their lives. As part of this process, we suggest incorporating these values
                                into children&#39;s games and play, and to create children&#39;s versions
                                of the MDGs that include these ethical, moral, and spiritual dimensions to
                                imbue young people with the worth and importance of the development
                                goals.</p>
                            <p>The results of incorporating ethical, moral, and spiritual dimensions
                                into the MDGs will enable us to create a culture of peace where each human
                                life is valued, that each of us understands we come here with a purpose,
                                and we all acknowledge our sacred responsibility to care for each other and
                                the world.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and sustaining a more equitable
                    civilization, a global interfaith movement has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement
                    by focusing primarily on positive interfaith and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
