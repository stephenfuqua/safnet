                        <p>Even as continued violence has stalled efforts to bring food aid to
                            desperate refugees, the U.N. has failed to enact meaningful measures to reign
                            in the Sudanese government. This month&#39;s breakthrough talks between the
                            government and southern rebels must be applauded; nevertheless, the
                            government&#39;s failure to disarm local militias has shown the potentially
                            duplicitous nature of their negotiations. While religious responses to the
                            warfare have been relatively few and far between, religious groups can play a
                            strong role in agitating for greater action, as seen in the following

                        <p>NAIROBI - November 18, 2004: An historic meeting of United Nations
                            Security Council started today in Nairobi, Kenya with an agenda focusing on
                            the protracted war in Sudan.</p>
                        <p>The Church in Africa and the World Council of Churches (WCC) presented a
                            four-point proposal to the Security Council for meeting&#39;s deliberations.
                            They were:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>That it is in the interest of the people of the Sudan, the
                                International Community and the Church in Africa that the Security Council
                                puts her utmost and unequivocal pressure on all the parties of the peace
                                process in the Sudan to find a lasting solution to the conflicts in Sudan
                                and to achieve a just and sustainable peace.</li>
                            <li>That the final comprehensive peace agreement be signed and its
                                implementation be witnessed and guaranteed by the International
                                Community.</li>
                            <li>That good governance be established throughout the Sudan to allow
                                groups of the Civil Society to play their full part in building a Culture
                                for Peace.</li>
                            <li>That the International Community through the United Nations and African
                                Union be mandated to provide mechanism for peace keeping and to ensure the
                                smooth Implementations of the Peace Agreement in the South and the Darfur
                                Regions.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Their concerns were expressed in a letter to the Security Council members
                            written by Rev. Dr. Mvume Dandala, General Secretary, All Africa Conference
                            of Churches and Dr. Agnes Abuom, World Council of Churches Africa
                            President.</p>
                        <p>The Security Council meeting in Nairobi is expected to sharpen global
                            attention on the plight of the Sudanese who have never known peace since
                            their country gained political independence in 1956. The only time they
                            enjoyed some peace interlude was from 1972 to 1983 as a result of Addis Ababa
                            peace pact brokered by AACC and WCC.</p>
                        <p>In their letter Rev. Dandala and Dr. Abuom pointed out that the Church
                            continues to stand with the oppressed people of Sudan as individual
                            institutions or through WCC, AACC, northern Ecumenical Partners, Sudan
                            Ecumenical Forum, Sudanese Christian Councils and the Fellowship of Christian
                            Councils and Churches in the Great Lakes and the Horn of Africa
                            (FECCLAHA).</p>
                        <p>Kenya has been the host of the Sudan Peace talks under the auspices of
                            Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD). To date, six peace
                            protocols have been agreed upon during the talks between Sudan People&#39;s
                            Liberation Movement / Army (SPLM/A) and the Sudanese government. The talks
                            adjourned in May this year and were due to be resumed in July when Darfur
                            region was plunged into widespread massacres consequently stalling the peace
                            talks.</p>
                        <p>The Security Council will also deliberate on the Darfur crisis and its
                            humanitarian catastrophe. Rev. Dandala and Dr. Abuom noted &quot;this
                            conflict has led to the deaths of over 2 million Southern Sudanese with many
                            more living in intolerable and inhuman conditions as Uprooted People.
                            Whereas, many others are languishing inside the Sudan as Internally Displaced
                            Persons (IDPs).</p>
                        <p>The effects of conflicts have now extended to Darfur Region. It is
                            estimated that about one million people have so far fled their homes into
                            neighbouring country - Chad. Whereas, over 50,000 have been killed. Their
                            homes and sources of livelihood have also been destroyed&quot;</p>
                        <p>Russia and China who are members of the Security Council are major
                            suppliers of arms to Khartoum government. Russia is currently also
                            reconditioning Khartoum&#39;s&#39; mig-jet fighters, according to various
                            informed sources.</p>
                        <p>As Khartoum enjoy&#39;s a fortune from oil exports valued at US$ 30
                            billion a year, it is reported to be spending US$ one million a day to
                            finance the war.</p>
                        <p>Among the protocols agreed upon are on wealth sharing, power sharing and
                            cessation of hostilities. The parties are due to deliberate on two remaining
                            protocols one on comprehensive peace agreement and the other on modalities
                            for the implementation of all the protocols.</p>
                        <p>One of the snags to be tackled relate to the new security arrangement
                            protocol in which it was agreed that SPLA would be transformed to become part
                            of the national army based in southern Sudan.</p>
                        <p>Khartoum insists that it will be the responsibility of SPLM to meet the
                            remuneration costs as well as its transformation and services. SPLM/A
                            contents that since SPLA will be part of the national army, its costs should
                            be met by the national vault. They (SPLM/A) further contend that since South
                            Sudan is one of the most under-developed parts of the world and its natural
                            resources having been exploited by others, it cannot afford the cost of
                            transformation of its army as well as costs of other urgent needs for human
                            development.</p>
                        <p>The Security Council meeting in Nairobi is the first ever in Africa and
                            also the first ever outside New York for the last 14 years. Soon after the
                            council&#39;s meeting, technical committees of SPLM/A and Khartoum government
                            are due to meet to thrash out contentious issues in preparation for the final
                            round of peace talks.</p>

                <p>Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
                    sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement
                    has sprung from the
                    grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net (INN) seeks
                    to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive interfaith
                    and religious news, events,
                    and resources.</p>
