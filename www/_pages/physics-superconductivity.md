Whilst its real-world applications are yet difficult to find, superconductivity may well prove to be one of the greatest discoveries of the 20th century. Herein we examine the physics behind this phenomenon, touch upon some of the applications we have developed thus far, and give some indication of the future development. Intended for the literate yet not necessarily technical audience, with no pictures or equations but plenty of links.  _Originally published at Kuro5hin, a techno-geek community website._

The phenomenon of superconductivity is a fascinating one that,
like many other important discoveries in the 20th century, was not
expected when first detected (c.f. <a href="http://www.scotlandmag.com/issue/2/scottish_innovators/62">penicillin</a>,
<a href="http://www.nobel.se/physics/laureates/1937/"> electron diffraction</a>). At the time of its discovery in 1911, it was known
that the _conductivity_ of a metal--the ease with which
electrical current passes through the substance--increases as it
cools down. However, as Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes was
investigating this property of metals, he stumbled across a
never-before seen state of perfect conductivity in mercury when he
cooled it with liquid helium (to 4.2 kelvin, or -268.80 C). Thus
his experiments were the first to show that certain elements can
have perfect--infinite!--conductivity at the right temperature, implying a loss
of all resistance to electron flow _(resistivity)._

Electrical conductivity is what makes our microwave popcorn, and
the television set we eat it in front of, possible: strands of
metallic wire (generally copper) carry electric current from the
power plant to our homes. The better the conductivity in the wire,
the better it will be able to carry current to your home and supply
the electricity needed to run your appliances. Certain physical
properties of metals make them good conductors, while non-metals
are generally considered insulators (that is, they will not pass a
current through them, similar to your garden-variety Thermos).

But let us get a better understanding of conduction before we
move on. Metals (conductors) allow small charged particles called
electrons to flow through them, much like a tube through which
water flows. Naturally, current--be it electrons or water--can flow
back-wards or forwards through its conduit. The direction of flow
is simply a matter of where you start it from.

Resistivity is the opposite of conductivity. Resistivity, as its
name implies, is a literal blocking of flow--like a boulder in a
stream or sandpaper that _resists_ movement across a wooden
block. And when you finally do get that sandpaper to move across
the block, it requires a greater output of energy (or power, which
is energy per unit of time) from you than just moving a regular
piece of paper. Resistivity operates the same way: the more
resistance a metal has, the more power is lost. This means that one
must continually add energy--or, in the case of power lines,
electricity--to the system in order to have a “constant”
current flow. Without adding more energy, all of the electricity
would eventually become lost power, adding unwanted dollars to your
electric bill.

The resistance itself arises from intramolecular collisions. As
the electrons flow through the metal, they often run into atoms.
These atoms are then like the rocks in the creek that obstruct
flow: resistance. Resistivity! Electrons, furthermore, belong
to a class of particles (<a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/particles/spinc.html#c2">fermions</a>) whose general behavior
encourages collisions.

Fermions are not alone in the world of particles; there also
exists a class of elementary particles called _<a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/particles/spinc.html#c3">bosons</a>._
Primarily, two factors differentiate the two types: _spin_ and
group behavior. Spin is a quantum mechanical term for an intrinsic
property of particles', it can be in whole units (-1,-0,1,2, and so
on) or in halves (-1/2,1/2,3/2, etc.). Bosons are those particles
that have whole member spins, while fermions are all of those
(including electrons) with half member spins. Aside from the spin,
these two classes exhibit opposite behavior while in groups: while
bosons like to act together, no two fermions can be in the same
state at the same time (the _<a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/pauli.html#c2">Pauli Exclusion
Principle</a>)._ This is a quantum mechanical rule, a law of nature
if you will. For fermions, this means that two electrons (or any
other fermion particle) cannot both be doing the same thing in the
same place at the same time. For instance, I once heard a joke that
illustrates the matter well:

> "Two electrons walk into a bar. The first asks for a gin and tonic. The second
> slams his hand on the table and says "Damn, that's what I wanted!"

Because they cannot travel together, in the same state, there is
much chaos in an electron's life. And, as we all know, chaos leads
to trouble. In this case, the chaos of energetic electrons
traveling in such a haphazard way leads to many collisions, much
like cattle stampeding every which way and bumping into each
other.

Bosons are not like this, however. For bosons actually prefer to
be in groups together, if a particle can prefer anything. Indeed,
it turns out that the more bosons there are traveling together, the
more likely it becomes that _all_ of the bosons in a system
will be in the same state. Thus it is not long before all of the
bosons are traveling together under the same conditions.

When you cool down a material, you are doing the same thing as telling a child
to "cool down." That is, you are telling the child to have less energy and be
less agitated. When you cool down the material, the electrons have less energy
and are less agitated. With less energy, fewer collisions occur and the
resistivity is lowered. Life becomes more ordered. Experience, however, had
always shown that the resistivity would bottom out at a certain positive value
different for each material. This bottoming out factor is due to the impurities
in the substance, which will always cause some small amount of disorder.

Onnes's discovery showed once again that experience fails to reveal the full
story of reality. As he cooled the mercury down, he found that it exhibited the
same tendency to decrease in resistivity as all other metals had. However, in
1908 Onnes had developed a system to liquefy helium (for which he won the <a
href="http://www.nobel.se/physics/laureates/1913/">Nobel Prize</a>), which is
much colder than the liquid nitrogen that was typically used in these kinds of
experiments. Utilizing his new invention, he cooled the mercury down to 4.2
kelvin and noticed that all resistivity disappeared at this critical
temperature. (The critical temperature is usually denoted
T<sub>c</sub><sup>)</sup>. He dubbed the new attribute _superconductivity._

Though most good conductors (such as copper and silver) do not have
superconductor characteristics, many other elements and even complex materials
achieve zero resistance at critical temperatures. When Onnes performed his
experiments, and indeed for many years to follow, there was no understanding of
the mechanisms whereby superconductivity occurs. In 1957 John Bardeen (inventor
of the transistor), Leon Cooper, and J. Robert Schrieffer formulated a theory to
explain superconductivity, leading to their own <a
href="http://www.nobel.se/physics/laureates/1972/"> Nobel</a>.

<a href="http://www.chemsoc.org/exemplarchem/entries/igrant/bcstheory_noflash.html">BCS
theory</a>, as it is called for its inventors, postulates that
electrons can actually form pairs which act as bosons instead of
fermions (Cooper pairs). Though electrons normally repel each other
due to their like charges, at very low temperatures the lattice
structure of the atoms in a superconductor material becomes
distorted by the passing of an electron. From this distortion
arises a weak force that actually attracts a second electron to the
first. Though the two are not physically bound together, it is as
if they were in a three-legged race and forced to act
cooperatively. Thus the two spin one half’s become one spin
one and the Cooper pair acts like a boson instead of two separate
fermions.

As bosons, the Cooper pairs naturally draw each other into cooperative states.
At T<sub>c</sub>, the pairs move together in the same direction and all with the
same status: we have organization and no resistance. Instead of having a chaotic
stampede, the cattle are now herded in an orderly manner. But as soon as you
introduce even small amounts of energy, the cattle get agitated and start to
move around. Pretty soon they are all scared and the order is completely
destroyed. Back to resistivity we go.

Thus superconductors achieve zero resistivity when they reach T<sub>c</sub>. And
zero resistivity of course means that we now have perfect conductivity &mdash; zero
power loss and a persistent current. In fact, some superconductors have been
tested which are so good at conducting current that a current could last in them
without power loss for 100,000 years.

Not only do these materials have perfect conductivity, but they also have an
additional defining factor, the <a
href="http://www.physics.ubc.ca/~outreach/p420_97/bruce/meissner.html"> Meissner
effect</a>. The Meissner effect refers to the ability of superconductors to keep
magnetic fields from passing through them. Instead the magnetic field flows
_around_ the superconductor. In a normal material, the magnetic field passes
through the interior uniformly. In the superconductors state however, the
Meissner effect kicks in and the flow of magnetic field around the material
causes the material to <a
href="http://www.fys.uio.no/faststoff/ltl/levitation/"> repel permanent
magnets</a>. Combined, these two properties create a wealth of potential
applications such as trains that levitate on superconductors magnets, efficient
switches, amplifiers and other circuit components, power lines, and motors and
other propulsion systems.

Unfortunately, the practical use of liquid helium is prohibitively expensive.
Thankfully J. Georg Benorz and K. Alex Müller made a remarkable <a
href="http://www.nobel.se/physics/laureates/1987/presentation-speech.html">
discovery</a> in 1986: lanthanum-barium-copper-oxide
(La<sub>2-x</sub>Ba<sub>x</sub>Cu<sub>4</sub>) achieves superconductivity at a
critical temperature of 30 kelvin. Not only was this the highest T<sub>c</sub>
ever found, but the discovery also led to research in a whole new class of
materials: ceramics. Later that same year, the ceramic
YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub> was discovered to exhibit zero
resistance at 92 kelvin. For the first time, superconductivity was attainable at
liquid nitrogen temperatures. Continuing research&nbsp;has brought that
temperature up to 130 kelvin, still quite cold by human standards (-143&deg; C),
but easily attainable with <a
href="http://www.trigas.com/Products&amp;Services/FoodGroup/FoodGroups.html">off-the-shelf
components</a>. Strangely, BCS theory does not seem a good fit for high
T<sub>c</sub><sup> </sup>superconductivity, and a <a
href="http://physicsweb.org/article/world/12/12/3">new theory</a> yet to be
settled upon.

High temperature superconductivity gives new life to all of the applications
that physicists once dreamed of, but never thought fiscally possible. While
there is much work and research <a
href="http://physicsweb.org/article/world/15/1/8/1">still to come</a>,
superconductors are beginning to show up in applied technologies, such as the <a
href="http://www.rtri.or.jp/rd/maglev/html/english/yamanashi_testline_E.html">Yamanashi
Maglev Test Line</a> (rail) in Japan, <a
href="http://www.pirelli.com/en_42/cables_systems/energy/innovation/hts_power_system.jhtml">electric
power transmission lines</a> in Detroit, and enhanced <a
href="http://www.lanl.gov/superconductivity/biodev.shtml">Magnetic Resonance
Imaging</a> for medical testing. The cutting edge of experimental research is
finding superconductivity in <a
href="http://flux.aps.org/meetings/YR97/BAPSMAR97/abs/S2850.html">fullerenes</a>,
<a href="http://physicsweb.org/article/world/15/1/9">ferromagnets</a>, and other
materials, while the theoretical focuses on finding that new theory and
determining an upper limit for any T<sub>C</sub>. The limits to
superconductivity and its applications... well, they just may not exist. And
thus it may be on the back of infinite conductivity that we ride to our
Jetsonian future.
